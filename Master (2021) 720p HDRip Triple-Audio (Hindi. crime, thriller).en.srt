Mother

00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,725
'Appa...!'

6
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,362
'Let's kill this boy also, partner'

7
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,448
If we burn all the evidence
we will be the prime suspects

'We need a witness
to speak in our favor'

9
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,077
All that is fine

10
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,705
Just like his father, what if he also
makes trouble insisting on being truthful?

11
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,541
Let's find out right away

12
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,876
Hey boy
What's your name?

13
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,920
- Bhavani
- Huh?

14
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:51,922
Bhavani

15
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,549
How did your parents die?

16
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,637
They were burnt to death
in a gas explosion

17
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,138
[loud laughter]

18
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,351
He sure knows to survive, I say

19
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:05,978
After we use him as a witness

20
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,730
...let us complain against him
for stealing our union funds

21
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,399
'His father is Lorry Union leader'

22
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,110
If we claim his son stole union cash
will anyone believe that story?

23
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,070
Sudden show of mercy, huh?

24
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,030
He's so young, that's why

25
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,032
Hey boy, listen

26
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,911
I'll send you to a place where boys
like you are well looked after

27
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,913
Will you go there?

28
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,960
'Govt Juvenile Observation Home
Nagercoil, Kallakurichi'

29
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,882
'That boy shouldn't sleep
even one night in peace'

30
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,009
I've given you more than
what you asked

31
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,135
Thank you, brother

32
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:41,555
If there's any kind of foul play
Esakki will hunt you down and kill you

33
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,056
- Keep an eye
- I'll take care, bro

34
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,564
'Hey! Come'

35
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,900
'What are you glaring at him for?'

36
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,781
Hey! You want the luxury of sleep, huh?

37
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,704
What are you looking at?

38
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,080
Wipe it

39
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,415
Wipe my boots

40
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,002
Pickle you to pieces, rascal!

41
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,382
'All of you, move aside'

42
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,550
'Bro!'

43
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,014
Die!

44
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,689
Hey you! Can't hit you more than this

45
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,316
Standing

46
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,151
Standing so still
least bit affected!

47
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,862
You are hitting me mercilessly
because someone is paying you

48
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:42,032
I have to pay you much more
to make you stop hitting me

49
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,868
I am penniless
Hit me all you want

50
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,578
When I have the money

51
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,746
I'll call you then

52
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,507
[phone ringing]

53
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,763
- Who is this?
- 'Brother'

54
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,765
'That boy Bhavani has escaped from jail'

55
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,934
Scumbag! Is this why
I'm spending so lavishly?

56
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,896
I'll deal with you in person
Find him before daybreak

57
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,190
Scumbag!

58
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,414
'Don't worry, Brother'

59
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,915
I won't harm you

60
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:35,335
'If I had wanted to, I could have easily
slit your neck when you were asleep'

61
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,714
But I can't be on the run
throughout my life

62
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,175
I came here to request you
to let me lead a normal life

63
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,384
I don't understand

64
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,513
Let me live my own life

65
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,891
What do I gain by releasing you, huh?

66
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,976
Give me a chance
for just this 1 week

67
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,854
I'll give you half of
what I earn this week

68
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,731
'Whichever week I don't pay you'

69
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,816
...stab me on that same day
at that same spot

70
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,985
Fine, I'll take a chance on you

71
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,321
This week is yours, go

72
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,744
How much do you usually pay for a lorry
to cross the check post without a permit?

73
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,496
Only if you cough up Rs 1000 per lorry
you'll be allowed to pass

74
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,290
I'll get the permit slip

75
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:15,000
Rs 1000 is yours to keep

76
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,793
I want Rs 100 per lorry

77
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,837
If the policemen hassle us?

78
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,425
That's my responsibility

79
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,187
What, I say?
What do you want?

80
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,077
'2002-2003
Register'

81
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,295
Go...go

82
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:03,757
Move...move

83
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,592
Come, quick

84
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,094
Hey! Wait...wait

85
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:08,887
Hurry up

86
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,520
If you want the permit slip in your hand

87
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,689
I must get Rs 500 per lorry

88
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,733
Got it?

89
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,591
Whether I'm here or not

90
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,177
...ensure the boys get
their share of booze and fag

91
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,516
'Govt Reformatory'

92
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,589
In a way, only we are
responsible for all this, partner

93
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:28,800
When we killed his father
we should have burnt him to ashes too

94
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:34,431
Now he has the gall to contest as head
in the Lorry Drivers' Union Election

95
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,518
How did he amass
this much wealth, bro?

96
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:42,189
Logu, do you know how many
lorries run under his control?

97
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,150
On top of it, he owns a meat factory

98
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,610
He is into exports too

99
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,571
All this is common news, partner

100
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,074
These boys in the reformatory
for juvenile delinquents

101
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,910
'He uses them to do something
That's where the money flows in'

102
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,788
Some even say he plays proxy
to a minister to launder his money

103
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,083
If he wins this year's Union election

104
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,045
...he will stoop to any level
to avenge his father's murder

105
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,173
Doesn't make sense to spare him
beyond this stage, partner

106
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,145
Talk of the devil!

107
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,438
Close his chapter

108
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,963
Hello, my dear boy
Hindu, Muslim, Christian

109
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,424
You seem to have the charms
of all the Gods around your neck

110
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:51,967
Each sect endorses
a particular God

111
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,178
One God will save me
when I'm in danger

112
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,596
Minimum guarantee

113
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:56,722
Philosophy?

114
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:01,894
Is this the same chap who pleaded
when he was 17 to spare his life?

115
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,690
We need to discuss something
very important with you

116
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,901
You were paying us
on a weekly basis all these years

117
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,360
You can stop it

118
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,447
Instead you can sell all your assets

119
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,657
'Go and earn a living
somewhere outside India'

120
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,076
I felt the same and
wanted to tell you next week

121
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,703
'For how long?
That too every week'

122
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,955
How can I pay tax to you
to ensure my life is not at risk?

123
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,749
That's why I've decided
to stop payment

124
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,587
That decision isn't
yours to take, scumbag!

125
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,631
'Just zip your lips
and obey our orders'

126
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,466
I will do only what I feel is right

127
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:33,675
Hey...dai!

128
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,094
I am well aware of
how dirty your hands are

129
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,931
Making those boys surrender
for the crimes you commit

130
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,600
'Instigating them to kill
We know about all your offenses'

131
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,144
Don't show off your temerity
Just tuck your tail and scoot

132
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,064
Otherwise you will meet your death
in our hands, watch it

133
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,107
[mocking laughter]

134
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,360
[imitating laughter]

135
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,612
Look around you
This is my area

136
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:54,821
'If I set my heart on it'

137
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,490
Only your lorry will move from here

138
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:57,658
Not you

139
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:01,787
I think you are unable to differentiate
working for money and for gratitude?

140
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:03,622
Shall I show you a sample?

141
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,753
Listen! We have an important
work to do, come here

142
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,506
'He is calling us, come'

143
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,926
- 'Bhavani, da
- Why is he calling us suddenly?'

144
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:22,391
Whoever kills these 3 men
in this spot will be rewarded

145
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:23,934
With a prize money

146
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,854
2 million

147
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,647
[burst of amused laughter]

148
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,861
'Do you realize where you are
and what you are blabbering?'

149
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,737
You think I work for brother
with money as motive?

150
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,281
We go back a long way, da

151
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,366
- 3 million
- If you raise it 50%?

152
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,410
- 'He is like my own brother'
- 4 million

153
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,704
Why are you keeping quiet
when he's so arrogant, bro?

154
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:44,872
Just say 'yes'
I'll kill him-

155
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:45,998
5 million!

156
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,918
- How dare you rattle off?
- 6 million

157
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,503
Hey! Kill him now

158
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,839
Wait...let us hear our brother out!!

159
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,091
7 million

160
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:57,843
Wait...wait, bro

161
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:00,804
I'll go up to the gate and
make sure no one enters this area

162
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,639
- 8 million
- What?

163
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:03,807
Move aside

164
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:09,354
Then shall we lock
the deal for 8 million?

165
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,647
- Okay, bro
- Are you ready?

166
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,066
We will divide 8 million equally
I'll deal with these 3 men

167
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,366
Now do you know the difference
between greed and gratitude?

168
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,369
Bro, chopper

169
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,127
I don't need this

170
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,879
I'll give you 2 minutes

171
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:35,422
Kill me if you can

172
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,926
And save yourself

173
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,318
Hey!

174
00:12:58,695 --> 00:12:59,905
Hey!

175
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,315
These boys?

176
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:36,817
Yes, sir

177
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,696
Post mortem matches the crime scene?

178
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,281
They have done a neat job, sir

179
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,825
Not knowing to drive
they ran over a man

180
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,285
You expect me to buy this?

181
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,911
'Whom are you trying to trick?'

182
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,913
Sir, I'm not a professional driver

183
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,124
I thought I'll try my hand
But turned out fatal

184
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,542
- Right?
- Yes, sir

185
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:57,171
- 'Do they have a past history?'
- Yes, sir

186
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:58,755
Pickpocket case, 511

187
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,133
Then 6 months they were in
a Govt reformatory

188
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,427
Now they are in IPC 302
Punished for murder

189
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,678
Is this a reformatory?

190
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,430
Or a criminal training center?

191
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,766
Why do you need this reformatory
that turns a thief into a murderer?

192
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,436
- Call the Observation home staff
- Okay, sir

193
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:14,354
Sir, he's calling you

194
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,150
Good afternoon, sir
I am the superintendent here

195
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,111
Forget the introduction, when do you
intend employing a regular master?

196
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:24,072
The boys drive away
any master we appoint

197
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,617
Actually scared of them,
no teacher wants to take up this post

198
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,118
But how can you run a school?

199
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,953
'Not one teacher so far, huh?'

200
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,122
Shocking and shameful!

201
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:36,418
If there's no master to teach
or guide the students

202
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,337
'...how will they reform, huh?'

203
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,548
'I have personally seen
30-40 cases like this here'

204
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,884
'Superintendent, I'm passing a Govt order'

205
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:47,596
'Send it to all private, Govt schools
and colleges, to every single institution'

206
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:48,889
Whole of Tamil Nadu

207
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,350
'You'll find a master
for sure, understand?'

208
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:52,935
Type out the order

209
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,737
"They call me master
Changes will happen faster"

210
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:11,411
"His entry spells power"

211
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:12,829
"Who is our master?
Commander...!"

212
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,832
'St Jeffery College is a truly renowned
educational institution in Chennai'

213
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,835
'Alumni of this college
have carved a name'

214
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:21,922
'In cinema, politics, advertising and
are celebrities in their own might'

215
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:24,424
This college has molded innumerable VIPs

216
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:30,138
'Students are very eager to make this
a very memorable reunion'

217
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,474
Do you want to know why?
Come along with me

218
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:36,728
Hi...Ramya

219
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,730
- Hi, nice to meet you
- Same here

220
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:40,440
I've spoken to you over the phone

221
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,650
- Oh! That was you?
- Yeah

222
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,818
Okay...okay

223
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,070
- What's your full name?
- Charulatha Prasad

224
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,573
Come, let me introduce you to everyone

225
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,617
- This college has a decorum
- Students are capable of doing it

226
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,745
Their plan is to ruin our image when
the minister arrives as our chief guest

227
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,331
'If this issue leaks,
your college reputation is at stake'

228
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,500
You want to take further action

229
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,752
- Do so after the minister leaves
- This is well planned

230
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,713
'Sri, stop this cat & mouse game'

231
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,132
- You had better confess the truth
- Trust me, sir

232
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:06,925
- Isn't JD responsible?
- No, sir

233
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,135
I swear, no, sir

234
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:10,596
Then who is the culprit?
Your father...?

235
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:12,764
Everyone knows about Savitha's trauma

236
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,850
I know how those 2 scumbags
sexually harassed her-

237
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,143
Hey! Mind your words

238
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:17,603
Spit that gum first

239
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:20,814
I said throw it out

240
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:22,608
I'll trash it as soon as
it loses its sweetness

241
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:23,901
Don't act smart

242
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,153
The two noble souls
who sexually harassed her

243
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,863
You suspended them for 1 week

244
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,407
Knowing it was inadequate
we even complained to the police

245
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:32,826
But they took us for a ride
without taking any action

246
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:35,078
Only then we knew Aadith's dad
is a rich businessman

247
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,497
I think he has planned
to send them off to Canada

248
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:39,416
That's why I took the boys

249
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,168
'...to his house
to find out his plan'

250
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:45,714
'Hello, sir, they haven't
left the house as yet'

251
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:47,007
'I think they are still inside'

252
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:49,718
'But it's evident they have
hatched a plot to escape'

253
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,471
'Strangers keep walking in to their house'

254
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,806
'Sir, I can hear their voices
I think they are coming out'

255
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,433
- 'Take care, son
- Don't worry, pa'

256
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:58,852
- Be safe
- I'll call as soon as I reach

257
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,354
'This is the duo'

258
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:01,605
'Call after you reach the airport'

259
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:02,856
Go...go...go

260
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:04,816
Let's follow them

261
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,946
Both of them have left home, sir

262
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:11,406
Aadith and Rahul are in a taxi
They just crossed Ashok Nagar

263
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,700
'Along with our boys
I am following them, sir'

264
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,327
- Where are you, bro?
- 'At a signal'

265
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,579
- Which signal?
- Jafferkhanpet

266
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:18,747
Ask him the bus number

267
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:20,332
- Which bus?
- '70 V'

268
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:21,375
Bus number, bro?

269
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,751
70, V

270
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,753
It's coming close to you
Waiting at the signal now

271
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:26,088
'Bro...look this side'

272
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,673
I've spotted you Come on, hurry up

273
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,174
'Look, it's that bus'

274
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,467
Quick!

275
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,515
- 'Get in'
- Move

276
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,433
Both of them got into
bus number 70 V, sir

277

'Bus has crossed
Jafferkhanpet signa-'

279
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:45,315

00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,351
Come

317
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:45,477
Hey!

318
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,145
Throw him out

319
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,611
Who is that?

320
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:55,946
Professor

321
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,286
'Bro, get up
Come...come'

322
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,620
Hurry up

323
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,125
'Hey driver, don't stop the bus'

324
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,543
Go...go...keep going

325
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:10,586
'Don't stop, keep moving'

326
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,048
[amused chuckle]

327
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,729
'Stop...stop'

328
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,855
'Stop, man'

329
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:31,857
'Let's get off
Come soon'

330
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,994
'They got down from the bus and ran'

331
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:45,454
Thank god he came in his bike

332
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,164
- It wasn't him
- Sorry, sir, he came

333
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:48,707
Sir, come

334
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:51,668
'In all this confusion
they ran into the Metro station'

335
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:53,545
Give me the token

336
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:55,923
Come fast

337
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:57,883
'Get in, quick'

338
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:34,920
It's really good.

339
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,965
I never got a chance to take a Metro train
from when it started operating

340
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:40,300
Thanks, boys

341
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,053
Hey...!

342
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,472
I plan to stab a master here

343
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:47,766
Brave hearts, continue the ride

344
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:49,560
Fainthearted, alight

345
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:50,811
Girls...girls

346
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,271
I'll collect it later

347
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,273
'If you move a bit,
I can go there and watch'

348
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,566
Thanks, sir

349
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:58,902
[smug chuckle]

350
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:52,956
What?

351
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:08,889
How are college students and
'dhoti' clad politicians connected?

352
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:18,065
Airport is close by

353
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,816
Catch an auto or something and go

354
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:21,777
Don't wait here
Hurry up

355
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:28,325
They rushed out and
got into a share auto

356
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,203
Turned out to be our friend
brother Jameel's auto, I got in too

357
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:33,705
'Easy-peasy that's where they got caught'

358
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:42,005
- Escape to Canada, right?
- Yes, sir

359
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,925
'Friends encircled and took them
to the police station, right?'

360
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:46,134
Yes, sir

361
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:48,512
So you were responsible
for everything

362
00:23:48,554 --> 00:23:51,098
- Yes, sir
- JD had nothing to do with this?

363
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,850
We swear, nothing at all, sir

364
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:53,767
'Sir'

365
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:56,562
Those 2 boys swear
your teacher JD was behind this

366
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,772
- These students are lying
- Of course I know, sir

367
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:00,023
JD is the culprit

368
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:02,150
- Who is JD?
- 'He is playing up with their support'

369
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,444
- I'll tell you, long story
- 'One day he'll get caught'

370
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:05,654
'That will be his doomsday'

371
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:06,780
Minister has arrived

372
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:09,157
If you are ready, we can
escort him to the auditorium

373
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:10,325
Come...come

374
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,869
Sir, you please sit

375
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,288
- I'll be back in 10 minutes
- I'll wait

376
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:15,789
- Serve him tea
- Carry on

377
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,082
2 minutes, sir
I'll be right back

378
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:18,500
Not picking your call, huh?

379
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,210
It's ringing but he isn't picking

380
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:22,838
Same-same when student
and now as master also?

381
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,090
Shut up, da
Vanathi, didn't you try?

382
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:26,508
I asked the students

383
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,260
- What did they say?
- He has been suspended

384
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:31,305
If you had told us earlier, we could
have gone in person and brought him

385
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,223
He must be very busy, try again

386
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:35,601
'We relish the 'rajma' happil-'

387
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:37,978
[mobile ringing]

388
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,272
"Livin' up and sippin on beer"

389
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:42,816
"Yeah, clap for me, man, right here"

390
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:44,860
Uncle, he's our Principal
Anbiah Samuel

391
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:46,528
Welcome, sir
This is our vice principal

392
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,908
'Ramya?'

393
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:53,493
If that student is such a troublemaker

394
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:55,621
...why not just dismiss him?

395
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:58,582
Then he should have
got dismissed 20 years ago!

396
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:00,083
I don't get it

397
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:01,752
JD isn't a student, my dear

398
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,961
Professor!

399
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:05,756
- What?
- Dean of student affairs

400
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,966
'First of all
we welcome you all'

401
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:10,010
'Good morning one and all present here'

402
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:13,013
'Our honorable chief guest
Manavai R Gauthaman'

403
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:15,641
'Respected dignitaries on the dais'

404
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:16,767
'What happened?'

405
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,908
Sir, students are refusing
to come from the back stage

406
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:34,284
Hey!

407
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:36,203
It seems you said this function
won't go on without JD?

408
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:38,622
Then what, sir? We kept
telling you he is not to blame

409
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:40,123
'You've suspended him for 2 weeks'

410
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:42,626
Any other day it's fine, sir
This alumni meet is only for him

411
00:25:42,668 --> 00:25:45,212
How can he not be here, sir?
Nothing will happen without him

412
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:47,172
Are you the human rights activist?

413
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:50,050
Just you wait!

414
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,511
Sir, the minister has been
waiting for a long time

415
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:54,847
- Please bear with us
- He cancelled so many appointments

416
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:57,599
- Start the program
- I'll talk to them and join you

417
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:03,772
Om Shanti! Om Shanti!
Peace in speech and spirit

418
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:06,024
- Call JD
- You suspended him and asking me to call?

419
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:08,277
- You call him
- I don't know his number

420
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:09,319
Call him, dude

421
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:10,988
Call before he changes his mind

422
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:14,741

Hello...huh...JD

00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:25,544
This is Principal...Samuel here

427
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:27,087
JD sir is fast asleep

428
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:28,130
Call later

429

Principal Anbiah Samuel

430
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:32,551
Anbu, your name can mean love but
he won't get up to hear your loving words

431
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:34,970
- Guzzled down 3 or 4 bottles
- 'Can you wake him up or not?'

432
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:37,014
Huh...? No chance, love

433
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:41,643
Hey!

434
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:43,020
He's drunk

435
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:45,063
What can I do?

436
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:47,816
Will you ask your Education Minister
to wait for half an hour?

437
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:49,109
We'll go and get him

438
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:51,028
- What?
- Do it

439
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:57,492
- What, da?
- Not budging an inch

440
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:03,957
Is this how you drum-roll?

441
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:05,918
Getting paid right?
Bump it, fellows

442
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:11,965
Rock & roll, man

443
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:13,800
This is it
This is what we want

444
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:15,677
Ready, da
Come on, da

Hey stop...stop

447
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,647
Lift him

448
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:29,733
Heave-ho!

449
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,043
Speed up!!

450
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:56,927
- Sir, good morning
- Good morning

- Sir, why this doubt?

'I swear they asked you to come'

455
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,790
Bro, beat the drum

456
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:38,927

Bent double, sir?

- Where is the ID card?
- I have it, sir

475

00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:24,551
Let's go

478
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,222
Hey, JD, come.

479
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:30,807
- 'Sit with us, JD'
- Is he a professor?

480
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:32,267
Suspended professor

481
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:33,602
'What is his name?'

482
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:34,728
'JD'

483
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:37,147
Start the program

484
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:38,774
Sir, 1 minute
Let me speak

485
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:39,816
Sir-

486
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:41,777
'Wait, child'

487
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:44,321
- JD
-'I've attended many college functions'

488
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:46,532
- Wear your ID card
- 'Witnessed many gatherings'

489
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:48,867
'But I've never seen a crowd like this'

490
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:51,328
Because the entire crowd here

491
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,622
More than the anchor of the show

492
00:31:53,664 --> 00:31:55,582
'They are celebrating
the man seated below'

493
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:57,125
'It is no mean achievement'

494
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:59,837
'If he is getting this kind of
reception among students'

495
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:03,090
'Then he must be a dedicated
and focused professor'

496
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:04,508
'If he himself is like this...'

497
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,677
- 'Imagine his students'
- Why try all these gimmicks?

498
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:07,928
'Must be good as gold'

499
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:10,973
'First give this man
a big round of applause'

500
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,268
To get a professor like him

501
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,478
You and your college
must be truly blessed

502
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,896
Your eyes are red
Wear this shade

503
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,815
'This most revered master'

504
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:22,943
'I would like him to come up
to the dais and say a few words'

505
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:25,279
'I am calling you, sir'

506
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,321
Please come

507
00:32:27,948 --> 00:32:29,324
Come up and speak

508
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:31,785
Hey...! Where are you going?

509
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:33,787
Wait, let me tell a mini story

510
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:35,205
Did you look at your shoes?

511
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:37,749
Instead of being humiliated, sit down

512
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:39,251
If you get up once more-D

513
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:41,170
Please take your seat

514
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:44,131
JD is our-

515
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:48,635
Management and staff
are completely against JD

516
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:50,804
But students celebrate him

517
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:52,598
I don't get this

518
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,309
He has gone out of his way
for students' welfare

519
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,102
Students revere him as their true hero

520
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:59,146
Reason enough for
the management to dislike him

521
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:01,815
Secondly after 6:00 p.m
our hero will be totally sloshed!

522
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:33,680
[indistinct]

523
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:35,557
Good morning, sir

524
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:44,024
Careful, sir

525
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:49,196
t- Sorry...sorry
- It's okay

526
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:52,908
Hi...hi

527
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,493
Your classroom is at that end

528
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:55,994
Oh! Good morning

529
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:58,914
'What is his flashback sob story
to get sloshed every day?'

530
00:33:58,956 --> 00:33:59,957
Don't ask him that alone

531
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:03,210
If he gets a gullible idiot, he'll reel off
a Mani Ratnam classic as his own!

532
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:05,921
Fell head over heels, chased her
in the college, bus, everywhere

533
00:34:05,963 --> 00:34:10,175
She also reciprocated and one day
we were happily sitting in a coffee shop

534
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:11,301
Her father walked in!

535
00:34:11,343 --> 00:34:13,679
- Aiyo! Did you get caught?
- Wait, sister

536
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,930
Her father's name

537
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:16,265
Mr Chandramouli!

538
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:18,058
We were both neighbors
in Rainbow Colony

539
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,060
I was in 8G
She was in 7G

540
00:34:20,102 --> 00:34:21,270
India is here

541
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:23,772
America is right here

542
00:34:23,814 --> 00:34:27,568
I took my guitar and left, my love for
Anjalai was as strong as 1000 elephants!

543
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:29,695
We climbed up straight to
the top of the mountain

544
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:32,155
We decided to jump
counting 1 to 5

545
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:34,616
My bad luck, I got stuck
in a tree and escaped death

546
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:35,951
What, da?

547
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:38,161
Her head hit a boulder and she died

548
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:40,330
- That's a Kamal classic...don't bug me
- Hey...listen

549
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:41,957
Too much filmy imagination

550
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:44,293
Okay, which department is he in?

551
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:47,254
He studied in this same college
He finished M.Phil Psychology here

552
00:34:47,296 --> 00:34:49,715
'Now he teaches
Personality Development'

553
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,884
May I request you all to please stand up?

554
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,721
I said...stand...up

555
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:59,057
Now I intend checking
if your mind and body are focused

556
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,517
We are hearing

557
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:02,853
But not listening

558
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:06,231
Students don't listen to their teachers
Teachers don't listen to their students

559
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:07,274
Now

560
00:35:07,316 --> 00:35:08,525
RUN

561
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:10,652
Run...run...run

562
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:11,737
WATER!

563
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:14,198
Electricity...!

564
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:20,078
Children don't listen to their parents
Parents don't listen to their children

565
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,288
And finally

566
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,540
The ____ doesn't listen to the people!

567
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:26,460
Whatever I tell you now
repeat it verbatim

568
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:27,503
But

569
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:29,296
Do just the opposite

570
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:30,756
Jump in

571
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:32,633
Jump left

572
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:34,635
Jump right
Dai...dai...!

573
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:35,969
Now on the starboard

574
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,013
Faster...faster...faster

575
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:40,474
Now close your bloody eyes and freeze

576
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:47,731
Class disperse

577
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:50,692
Getting late for my class

578
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:52,528
- We'll meet at lunch
- Okay, sure

579
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,159
'Let me repeat this'

580
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:01,620
That bloody Bhavani is
responsible for all this

581
00:36:01,662 --> 00:36:04,957
He finished off his opponents contesting
in our Union election one by one

582
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:06,917
I know his history A to Z

583
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:10,212
Gurumurthy, whether these people
understand it or not, hope you do

584
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:13,006
I have been saying this
right from the beginning

585
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:14,091
Who endorsed my view?

586
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:16,718
With the help of juveniles
he is into all criminal activities

587
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,970
Has the cat got your tongue?!

588
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:20,597
- Tell them
- Yov! We know this alread-

589
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:33,277
Hello, brother

590
00:36:34,528 --> 00:36:35,821
Damn you!

591
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:38,198
Are you such a big shot, huh?

592
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,535
If you kill him, will you get his post?

593
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:43,328
- Let me see
- No, bro

594
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:45,747
Why are you so mad at me?
I'm like a brother to you

595
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:47,040
Whatever it is
let's talk it over

596
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:48,917
Any need for me to talk to you?

597
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:50,085
I'll close your chapter!

598
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:51,170
Get the car ready

599
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:53,213
Bro, will a problem
be solved if we fight?

600
00:36:53,255 --> 00:36:55,632
Will murder solve the problem?
Let's discuss it amicably

601
00:36:55,674 --> 00:36:59,136
I'll use the same juvenile delinquents
you use as tool to finish you off!

602
00:36:59,178 --> 00:37:00,179
Want to wait and watch?

603
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,055
I'm like one of them
You watched me grow

604
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:04,016
- Wait, bro
- You peed in your pants scared of me

605
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:05,559
You think you're my equal now?

606
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:07,311
Whatever it is, let's talk it over

607
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:09,646
I am much younger than you
But pay heed to my words

608
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,814
Don't go, br-

609
00:37:11,523 --> 00:37:12,649
'Oh my God!'

610
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:14,026
Gone, brother?

611
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:16,069
Catch that lorry driver

612
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,076
So sad

613
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:24,244
You were eye witnesses

614
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:25,704
What did I do?

615
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:28,248
If I had walked out talking to him
I would've shared his fate

616
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,209
Impossible for a human
to time this so perfectly

617
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,002
I pray to all Gods thrice daily

618
00:37:32,044 --> 00:37:33,962
So God has saved me
and punished him

619
00:37:34,338 --> 00:37:35,714
'He was a good soul!'

620
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,928
To conduct Students' election
in our college this year

621
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:45,891
University Grants Commission has granted
permission, but I opposed it strictly

622
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:50,270
That's why for a mere formality
I need all your opinions

623
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:52,773
Why we don't want election

624
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:54,107
For the records

625
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:56,610
I somehow feel it is unnecessary, sir

626
00:37:56,652 --> 00:37:57,861
'Semester is fast approaching'

627
00:37:57,903 --> 00:37:59,988
'In the current scenario
why do we need an election?'

628
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,407
'Sir, if this is happening
some other issues will create'

629
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:04,868
r- I don't think they are fit for elections
- Exactly

630
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,662
'In my honest opinion, no'

631
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:09,081
'I have no issues with
the day college students'

632
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:11,333
'I am a little apprehensive
about the evening batch'

633
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:12,668
Thanks, Ramya

634
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:13,752
Charulatha, your opinion?

635
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:16,922
It's only been 2 weeks
since I joined, sir

636
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:19,675
So if I voice my opinion
I don't know if it will be right

637
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:21,301
Come on, what's there?

638
00:38:22,427 --> 00:38:23,512
- No, sir
- Hey!

639
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,014
- Why is JD sir keeping quiet?
- That's right?

640
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:28,976
- He'll wait to get a good point
- 'I don't think election is a good idea'

641
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:32,020
Sir, to be on the safe side
ask JD his opinion

642
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,651
'JD, tell us your opinion'

643
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:44,825
What is your opinion, JD?

644
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:47,077
- What day was yesterday?
- Thursday

645
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,662
Thursday is his day off, da

646
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:50,747
- 'Professor JD'
- He would have been piss drunk

647
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:53,250
- Come...come
- Hey! Careful

648
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:55,043
JD...?

649
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:58,213
SIR!

650
00:38:58,255 --> 00:38:59,423
Emergency, sir

651
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:00,507
What are you doing here?

652
00:39:00,549 --> 00:39:02,509
Let me give this phone to Rosie madam

653
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:04,344
Her husband fell off his bike

654
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:05,637
'What the hell are you doing?'

655
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:06,763
I will expel you

656
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:09,391
- Let her just talk to him
- What happened, Abdul?

657
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:10,434
'Wake up, sir'

658
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:11,977
Don't switch off your phone

659
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,103
Talk to him

660
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:14,688
- Poor husband
- 1 minute, sir

661
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,065
They are objecting to elections
Support us, sir

662
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:18,692
- Sorry, sir
- Get out

663
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:20,110
- Useless fellow!
- Thank you, sir

664
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:24,072
JD, what is your opinion
about conducting elections?

665
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:26,575
Election is essential, that's all

666
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:29,995
- I thought as much
- 'He will say something meaningless, sir'

667
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:33,832
If we announce a students' election
all of them will be thinking of only that

668
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:36,668
Not one of them will study
nor will anyone attend any class

669
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:40,005
Correct, what will they learn
by conducting students' election?

670
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:42,508
Why encourage politics in college?

671
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,301
Matthew sir

672
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:46,428
What is 'politics', sir?

673
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,388
Sir, I don't wish to talk to you

674
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:50,390
Is that so?
But I wish to speak

675
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:51,433
I'm coming

676
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,604
Sir

677
00:39:56,355 --> 00:39:59,066
First a student should know
'politics' means service

678
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:02,778
Only if our students learn about election,
canvassing, leadership in college

679
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:05,864
...they will have an awareness about
state, central elections for the future

680
00:40:05,906 --> 00:40:08,700
College students are our first time voters

681
00:40:09,117 --> 00:40:10,536
Only if (s)he is allowed to think

682
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:12,538
A new leader will emerge
for the next generation

683
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:15,415
To mould as a good leader
or to choose the right leader

684
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:17,668
...they will acquire
both tact and discretion

685
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:18,794
For someone to-

686
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:21,880
They will stick posters all over
and spoil the walls with graffiti

687
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:23,841
Then claim ownership
over the walls and fight

688
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:25,926
Doesn't all this happen
in normal elections?

689
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:26,969
Sit down, sir

690
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,806
Aren't these normal issues
that crop up in general elections?

691
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:33,308
So can we decide to
abolish elections in our country?

692
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:36,520
We have grown up with this culture of
poster, banner, fanfare, still follow it

693
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:40,232
If students should know
the do's and don'ts of poster etc

694
00:40:40,274 --> 00:40:42,401
...we must conduct
elections in college

695
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:44,111
Only then he will be
a good example outside

696
00:40:44,152 --> 00:40:48,448
'If our culture of bribing with 'biriyani'
booze and big bucks should change'

697
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,784
...students should know
the ins and outs of politics

698
00:40:50,826 --> 00:40:51,827
Okay

699
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,871
Let's assume what you're saying is right

700
00:40:53,871 --> 00:40:58,792
Who is responsible if students resort
to violence or damage college property?

701
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:00,919
Sir, nothing of that sort will happen

702
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:03,463
If you are proved wrong
will you leave this college?

703
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:05,716
Will you resign, huh?

704
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:07,801
We'll see if it happens

705
00:41:07,843 --> 00:41:10,095
Then you be the presiding officer

706
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,680
And conduct this election

707
00:41:12,097 --> 00:41:14,057
If any problem crops up

708
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:16,393
Sign an affidavit
you will leave this college

709
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:25,652
Coming June 25th
Students' elections

710
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:27,404
[loud cheering]

711
00:41:29,406 --> 00:41:32,117
I haven't seen him conduct
an election as a master

712
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:34,995
'But I've seen him
do the same as a student'

713
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:40,584
Pccht!

714
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:45,547
Shake your hands

715
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:53,055
This is the wall of democracy

716
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:54,890
Your rules & regulations

717
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:01,063
'Gym facilities free for all students'

718
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:03,524
'Meat will be served for all in the hostel'

719
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:05,901
'Good orators have become able leaders'

720
00:42:05,943 --> 00:42:07,611
You should speak up more boldly, Savi

721
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:09,988
'Instead of finding faults
with your rival and campaigning'

722
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,823
'...ask for votes
listing your reforms'

723
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:15,410
Tear every single poster, dude

724
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,330
Posters and banners should be stuck
or erected in their allocated places

725
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:20,541
'Even if there's a small brawl
among the students'

726
00:42:20,582 --> 00:42:22,000
'...election will be canceled'

727
00:42:23,293 --> 00:42:26,004
You pull back and fire

728
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:27,047
Cheers!

729
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:29,299
'Our total strength is 5500 students, sir'

730
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:31,593
We have divided them into 10 categories

731
00:42:31,802 --> 00:42:32,886
What is this column?

732
00:42:32,928 --> 00:42:35,597
That is religion & caste category

733
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:37,307
Let's avoid that

734
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:39,726
Only if we delete it here

735
00:42:40,352 --> 00:42:41,937
It won't tag along with us terribly

736
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:47,651
Hey! How much longer do you intend
drinking like this and roaming around?

737
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:49,403
Why yell at me
for no reason?

738
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:51,655
Will I yell at you
if you are steady on your feet?

739
00:42:53,615 --> 00:42:55,742
- I am sober
- Is that so?

740
00:42:57,244 --> 00:42:59,079
Hit an arrow
anywhere on this board

741
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:00,831
I'll agree you are
sober and steady

742
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:03,083
Machi, aim for the bull's eye

743
00:43:13,552 --> 00:43:15,387
Rs 1 lakh to students
in each department

744
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:16,972
Cheers!

745

'I have a fair amount of
experience in counselling'

746
00:43:20,392 --> 00:43:24,229
If you can tell me the reason
I can do my level best to help you

747
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:27,065
Earlier on...when I was jobless

748
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:30,736
I was hanging around
in a tiles company in Rajasthan

749
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:32,237
- Oh!
- At that time

750
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:35,032
A girl lost her bag in the train

751
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:38,035
I found it and sent it to her

752
00:43:38,118 --> 00:43:40,329
She liked me for the effort I took

753
00:43:40,996 --> 00:43:44,833
She and I became pen pals and
we built a 'Fort of love' just for us

754
00:43:45,918 --> 00:43:48,587
Then when she knew
I was in Rajasthan

755
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:50,380
For my sake that girl
took extra pains

756
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:54,384
Embroidered, knitted
a sweater and sent it to me

757
00:43:54,426 --> 00:43:55,844
Sweater in Rajasthan!

758
00:43:58,096 --> 00:43:59,097
True that?

759
00:44:08,607 --> 00:44:10,609
'Tomorrow if you have a problem
and you come to me'

760
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:12,569
'Even if it's midnight
I'll be there for you'

761
00:44:12,611 --> 00:44:15,697
Why should we create problems
and end up in the police station?

762
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:17,115
Beverages free in the canteen

763
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:19,409
Aqua training access free

764
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:22,746
You will have campus interviews
You'll leave the college with a job in hand

765
00:44:22,788 --> 00:44:24,748
Above all give this serious thought

766
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,792
Do you want to be ruled by a girl?

767
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:28,460
Or revel in a boy's leadership?

768
00:44:32,297 --> 00:44:35,342
Hey! That isn't even my glass

769
00:44:35,384 --> 00:44:37,970
Some other chap has relished
a drink and gone, madcap!

770
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:39,054
How dare you!

00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:10,586
'4th round, sir'

00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:12,212
Results are due any moment

777
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:14,548
I'm scared, sir

778
00:45:19,136 --> 00:45:21,388
Are you Satyaraj acting
as Amavasai in 'Amaidhi Padai'?

779

4th round it seems

780

Congratulations, chairperson

788
00:46:02,513 --> 00:46:05,599
Sir, I think they have already
started creating a ruckus there

789
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:07,059
Sir, what do we do now?

790
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,603
Why do you still ask me?
She's the captain of your ship

791
00:46:09,937 --> 00:46:12,105
Chairman, tell us what to do?

792
00:46:13,649 --> 00:46:14,650
'Sir'

793
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:18,820
To avoid all these unnecessary confusion
I'm thinking of talking to Bhargav directly

794
00:46:19,488 --> 00:46:20,531
Look at that!

795
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:22,074
By all means go and talk

796
00:46:22,241 --> 00:46:23,492
But go alone

797
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,661
Madam

798
00:46:25,744 --> 00:46:28,997
Don't dilly-dally, scratch your head,
crack your knuckles and keep looking back

799
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:30,749
Don't dawdle and
do 'instalment' walk

800
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:31,792
Forward march!

801
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:37,673
Sir, will you give me your bracelet?

802
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:38,966
Why?

803
00:46:39,007 --> 00:46:40,008
Please give, sir

804
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:41,134
'Dude, play that song'

805
00:46:41,218 --> 00:46:45,597
"Look! We must lead a life like that bird
Without a care in the world"

806
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:50,310
"We should go on a dancing spree
like the waves here in glee"

807
00:46:50,352 --> 00:46:54,857
"Under the same sky spacious
On the same land so precious"

808
00:46:54,898 --> 00:46:59,486
"Under the same sky endless
On our Motherland peerless"

809
00:46:59,528 --> 00:47:03,866
"Let's sing in unity our song
of what is our right all along"

810
00:47:03,907 --> 00:47:05,367
I want to talk to you

811
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:08,745
If she comes offering a truce
I'll break the bones on her face

812
00:47:09,413 --> 00:47:11,790
[song from 'Aayirathil Oruvan']

813
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:14,334
- Bro, tell me
- 'What happened?'

814
00:47:14,376 --> 00:47:15,627
Your son lost, bro

815
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:17,004
What?

816
00:47:17,045 --> 00:47:18,755
Bhargav...er-

817
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:20,966
I came to congratulate

818
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:24,887
Winning by just 60 votes
is no big victory at all

819
00:47:25,596 --> 00:47:28,724
Er...is there any rule in college
there should be only 1 chairman?

820
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:31,935
You take over day college
and I'll handle evening college

821
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,396
Okay, bye

822
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:36,690
Congrats

823
00:47:37,274 --> 00:47:39,318
I extended my hand
even on nomination day

824
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:40,736
You didn't want to shake hands

825
00:47:43,906 --> 00:47:45,574
At least let it be truce now?

826
00:47:46,742 --> 00:47:48,869
I don't think it's safe
for her to go alone

827
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:50,746
Shall I go and check, sir?

828
00:47:59,588 --> 00:48:00,672
'Let's shake hands'

829
00:48:01,924 --> 00:48:03,634
- Okay
- How ridiculous

830
00:48:03,675 --> 00:48:05,260
He has patched up happily

831
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:07,012
'He is shaking hands
with that girl who won'

832
00:48:07,054 --> 00:48:08,055
'Let me talk to him'

833
00:48:08,096 --> 00:48:09,097
1 minute, bro

834
00:48:09,223 --> 00:48:10,265
'Bhargav brother'

835
00:48:11,391 --> 00:48:14,311
Dad, there's no problem
I spoke to that girl

836
00:48:14,353 --> 00:48:16,563
She even asked me to be
the chairman for Day college, pa

837
00:48:16,605 --> 00:48:19,691
'You got a sudden desire to
beg a post from her, huh?'

838
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:22,569
It isn't what you think, pa
I'll come in person and explain to you

839
00:48:25,364 --> 00:48:27,533
- Bro
- 'Pack him home in our car now'

840
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:28,784
Okay, bro

841
00:48:28,825 --> 00:48:30,619
'If he refuses to go, threaten him'

842
00:48:30,661 --> 00:48:33,330
- 'Rough up that female who defeated him'
- I'll handle it

843
00:48:34,373 --> 00:48:36,625
I'll explain to my dad
Please don't create a ruckus

844
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:39,545
He has given me permission
to scar even your face, bro

845
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:40,838
First get inside

846
00:48:41,213 --> 00:48:42,631
But please don't hurt that girl

847
00:48:42,673 --> 00:48:44,508
Sir, he wasn't nasty to me

848
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,260
I shook hands and he said okay

849
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:47,970
That's all

850
00:48:48,053 --> 00:48:49,471
Celebrations are done

851
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:51,640
Hey! Catch

852
00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:52,516
Wear these IDS

853
00:48:52,724 --> 00:48:54,726
- Where's the booth?
- 1st floor, bro

854
00:48:54,768 --> 00:48:55,894
'Hurry up'

855
00:48:57,896 --> 00:48:59,523
Clear up all this mess
and then rock & roll

856
00:48:59,731 --> 00:49:03,986
Sir, evening college students are
planning to burn down the booth

857
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,414
- Who is he?
- Professor, bro

858
00:49:15,497 --> 00:49:17,249
- What, da?
- That wasn't a proper election

859
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:20,043
- We demand re-election or re-counting
- Election is over, that's all

860
00:49:20,085 --> 00:49:22,045
- Burn down the booth
- Which department are you?

861
00:49:22,087 --> 00:49:23,839
- Come here
- Stop this bloody idle talk

862
00:49:23,881 --> 00:49:26,008
I'll kill you, son of a gun
I'll break all your teeth!

863
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:27,551
- Sri, quiet!
- 'Give that bottle'

864
00:49:27,593 --> 00:49:28,760
- Wait
- Sir...!

865
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:32,639
- Sir, let go
- 'Shut up, all of you'

866
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:34,766
I'm trying to make peace-

867
00:49:34,808 --> 00:49:36,518
Sir
Move aside

868
00:49:36,602 --> 00:49:39,354
Evening college chairman candidate
Bhargav wants to talk to you, sir

869
00:49:39,396 --> 00:49:41,023
'My dad didn't listen to me'

870
00:49:41,064 --> 00:49:43,525
He has sent 50-60 Party riff-raffs
to bash up everyone in college

871
00:49:43,734 --> 00:49:47,279
'They have merged with the students
Ensure our college students are safe, sir'

872
00:49:52,117 --> 00:49:54,036
On the starboard!

873
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:56,371
- 'Why are all of them spinning?
- What are they doing?'

874
00:49:56,413 --> 00:49:58,498
Now close your bloody eyes and freeze

875
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,501
'What is this?
Tell us, bro'

876
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:02,044
'Sticking to the wall like glue?'

877
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:03,086
Move forward

878
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:04,671
'They are doing just the opposite'

879
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:05,756
'Wait, don't go'

880
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:13,096
Send all the girls home safe

881
00:50:13,222 --> 00:50:15,098
- Sir?
- Just do as I say

882
00:50:15,724 --> 00:50:17,476
Hey! Take all of them
through the back door

883
00:50:17,518 --> 00:50:19,019
Go...go...fast

884
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:20,395
'Go now'

885
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:44,586
SAVITHA, YOU GO!

886
00:50:45,629 --> 00:50:47,047
Hey! That's the girl

887
00:50:47,673 --> 00:50:48,715
'Grab her'

888
00:50:54,054 --> 00:50:55,097
Savitha

889
00:50:58,016 --> 00:50:59,601
Hey...hey!

890
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:05,774
Hey!

891
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:10,362
Are you okay?

892
00:51:16,034 --> 00:51:17,411
Go in...quick

893
00:51:21,248 --> 00:51:23,750
Sir, students are all out of control

894
00:51:29,256 --> 00:51:30,465
Let me go

895
00:51:30,507 --> 00:51:32,384
- Take your hands off
- Sir...sir

896
00:51:32,426 --> 00:51:33,677
TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF!

897
00:51:37,347 --> 00:51:39,850
How dare you manhandle girls!

898
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:01,580
Master...!

899
00:52:23,727 --> 00:52:25,729
Nothing major, just a nail scratch

900
00:52:26,104 --> 00:52:29,066
Dai! Meeting is being held in the library

901
00:52:29,107 --> 00:52:30,400
Is everyone safe, da?

902
00:52:30,442 --> 00:52:31,693
'I have checked all the groups'

903
00:52:31,735 --> 00:52:32,528
They have texted me

904
00:52:32,736 --> 00:52:35,989
The entire riot has been recorded
in our college CCTV cameras

905
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:37,658
Is he behaving like a professor?

906
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:40,118
Excuse me, ma'am, you are
talking about damage of property

907
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:42,829
Rowdies got together and
bashed up 4-5 of our girls

908
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:44,790
What could all the teachers do?

909
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:47,000
- No one came to stop them
- Stop it, Charu

910
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:49,545
It isn't even 1 month
since you joined this college

911
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:50,587
Just keep quiet

912
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,966
What the hell are they discussing?

913
00:52:54,383 --> 00:52:55,425
I'll be back

914
00:52:55,843 --> 00:52:57,052
I'll talk to JD

915
00:52:57,094 --> 00:52:58,971
Then we will take a call

916
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:02,057
If he intends coming back
we are resigning, sir

917
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:04,518
'WTH is this meeting in aid of?'

918
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:08,021
Sir, I have already given
a commitment I'll resign

919
00:53:08,105 --> 00:53:09,481
I'm just leaving this college

920
00:53:09,523 --> 00:53:11,233
JD, just wait in the car

921
00:53:11,275 --> 00:53:12,693
- 'I need to talk to you'
- Sir...?

922
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:13,735
I said 'wait'

923
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:18,282
'I understand'

924
00:53:18,448 --> 00:53:20,284
If they need to know your worth

925
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:22,619
A gap is essential

926
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:26,039
Your decision is correct

927
00:53:26,081 --> 00:53:28,041
You wanted a break for 3 months?

928
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:29,501
I have okayed it

929
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:32,087
When did I ask?

930
00:53:37,718 --> 00:53:39,094
Isn't this your signature?

931
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:42,431
Sir

932
00:53:43,015 --> 00:53:44,433
Carbon copy, sir

933
00:53:44,474 --> 00:53:45,851
Oh! Come on, JD

934
00:53:46,768 --> 00:53:49,605
Haven't you opted for a break
of 3 months, intending to teach?

935
00:53:49,646 --> 00:53:51,815
Teach? In which college?

936
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:53,984
College?

937
00:53:54,401 --> 00:53:56,570
As you have mentioned
Observation Home

938
00:53:57,362 --> 00:53:59,323
Sir, don't play the fool

939
00:53:59,364 --> 00:54:00,782
What will I do there?

940
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:02,117
I didn't sign this

941
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:06,288
Maybe after 6:00 p.m?

942
00:54:10,626 --> 00:54:12,211
After 6:00 p.m

943
00:54:12,586 --> 00:54:13,629
Good chance

944
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:14,922
See

945
00:54:15,714 --> 00:54:18,550
JD, you're losing control on yourself

946
00:54:21,845 --> 00:54:25,599
If there's any issue in the election
didn't you agree to resign your job?

947
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:28,101
That means you have
something on your mind

948
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:30,646
Fine, sir, I'll go

949
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:33,273
Well...I have many 'well' wishers here

950
00:54:33,315 --> 00:54:34,816
This must be their handiwork

951
00:54:35,651 --> 00:54:37,694
It's okay, I need a change too, I'll go

952
00:54:37,736 --> 00:54:41,114
'Inspector is waiting in your lodge
to explain the job you'll be undertaking'

953
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:44,368
'That means'

954
00:54:45,536 --> 00:54:46,828
- Needhimani
- Bro?

955
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:48,372
You didn't pass on any information?

956
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:49,748
No, bro

957
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:53,877
Then whatever lawyer sir
and I spoke in the union office

958
00:54:53,919 --> 00:54:56,713
- How did the police get to hear?
- That's what puzzles me, bro

959
00:54:59,091 --> 00:55:01,260
You know this music director Anirudh?

960
00:55:01,802 --> 00:55:04,054
He has composed a new film song

961
00:55:04,096 --> 00:55:05,722
Shall we listen?

962
00:55:09,017 --> 00:55:10,394
- Listen
- 'Bro'

963
00:55:10,727 --> 00:55:13,772
'Bhavani has fixed the date
You are his next target'

964
00:55:13,814 --> 00:55:16,275
'He has decided to kill you too
by framing it on those boys'

965
00:55:16,316 --> 00:55:17,734
What do you say, bigamist?

966
00:55:18,443 --> 00:55:20,988
At least is this your voice
or will you claim its mimicry?

967
00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:23,240
- Bro
- Did you call me, Bhavani?

968
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:28,662
Make sure the boys are supplied
their regular dose of drinks and drugs

969
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:31,540
Whether they get
3 square meals a day or not

970
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:34,668
Booze and dope should flow steadily

971
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:36,503
Okay, Bhavani
I'll see to it

972
00:55:38,338 --> 00:55:39,381
Where was I?

973
00:55:39,423 --> 00:55:41,800
You got me married and how
can you make my wife a widow?

974
00:55:42,885 --> 00:55:44,219
- Tell me, bro
- Wait

975
00:55:44,261 --> 00:55:46,847
I'm choking with emotion
hearing your sentimental speech

976
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:52,769
Why are you jerking?

977
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:56,648
I had tucked the knife in my waist
What if it pierces me in the wrong place?

978
00:55:57,065 --> 00:55:59,985
- Not that
- Suppose an enemy kills us

979
00:56:00,027 --> 00:56:02,529
Doesn't matter if they say
'that's how Bhavani died a noble death'

980
00:56:02,738 --> 00:56:06,241
If they say, 'he had tucked a knife
that stabbed him in a wrong spot'

981
00:56:06,283 --> 00:56:07,576
Does that sound good?

982
00:56:07,618 --> 00:56:09,077
- No
- No, right?

983
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,120
Won't sound good

984
00:56:10,245 --> 00:56:12,247
- Lean back comfortably
- Don't, bro

985
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:13,874
- Is that a show of respect?
- Yes, bro

986
00:56:13,916 --> 00:56:16,835
How is it over the phone
all this 'bro' kinship is missing?

987
00:56:16,877 --> 00:56:18,086
What is this?

988
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:20,297
- Lean back
- No, bro

989
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:22,549
Won't you comply with
your bro's death wish for you?

990
00:56:22,591 --> 00:56:24,676
Lean back...sit...sit...sit!

991
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:25,719
LEAN BACK!

992
00:56:35,604 --> 00:56:36,939
Dai Gopal!

993
00:56:38,273 --> 00:56:39,816
- Hey
- 'Yes, bro'

994
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:41,735
Tell me, bro

995
00:56:41,777 --> 00:56:44,446
Ask Das to pick 2 boys
10-15 years old to surrender

996
00:56:44,488 --> 00:56:45,739
- Okay, bro
- Go

997
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:46,823
Bro...?

998
00:56:46,865 --> 00:56:49,868
A new master has been recruited
for our reformatory it seems

999
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,537
- Okay...so?
- I don't know if you know

1000
00:56:51,745 --> 00:56:53,330
I thought I should inform you

1001
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:55,332
A teacher is bound to be appointed

1002
00:56:55,374 --> 00:56:58,377
All of you are giving a build up
as if it is Breaking News!

1003
00:56:58,669 --> 00:57:01,088
Dispose this body and
ask someone to drive this truck

1004
00:57:01,213 --> 00:57:02,381
Okay, bro

1005
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:06,593
"Creep like a lioness, make no sound"

1006
00:57:06,635 --> 00:57:09,596
"Slide like a snake, over sun baked ground"

1007
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:10,931
[song 'Rise Up']

1008
00:57:10,973 --> 00:57:12,933
Sir, can we switch off that cacophony!

1009
00:57:12,975 --> 00:57:15,227
Then shall I wear my coolers?!

1010
00:57:15,644 --> 00:57:18,564
"Twist like a hurricane, bend and sway"

1011

"Break like a wave, wash the filth away"

1012
00:57:28,532 --> 00:57:33,287
Sir, college students are bound by
certain protocols of parents and society

1013
00:57:33,328 --> 00:57:35,330
But those boys there
lack all that discipline

1014
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:38,834
Their age and their activities
have no connection whatsoever

1015
00:57:42,796 --> 00:57:45,382
'Not even a single inmate
is human or humane'

'They know our law is lenient
to their habitual crimes'

1020
00:57:54,266 --> 00:57:57,269
'They use it to their advantage
breaking laws as reckless criminals'

1021
00:57:58,562 --> 00:58:00,022
'That's why, I'm telling you, sir'

1022
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:03,233
Don't bend backwards to reform them
in those 3 months you are assigned there

1023
00:58:05,277 --> 00:58:08,113
Aren't you wondering
whether to go there or not?

1024
00:58:08,906 --> 00:58:09,948
'Sir...?'

1025
00:58:10,657 --> 00:58:11,700
'Sir...!'

1026
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:14,620
'Is our hero in dream world?'

1027
00:58:15,495 --> 00:58:17,372
Sir, check if that's your phone?

1028
00:58:17,998 --> 00:58:19,041
Bro...bro

1029
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,043
'Wake up, bro'

1030
00:58:21,877 --> 00:58:22,920
Not mine

1031
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:24,046
Oh! Brother's phone

1032
00:58:24,421 --> 00:58:26,715
That's no problem, sir
I don't mind going

1033
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:28,717
- I can handle them
- Sir

1034
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:31,303
So have you decided you're going?

1035
00:58:43,482 --> 00:58:44,691
Here

1036
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:47,319
Das...?

1037
00:58:47,986 --> 00:58:50,322
That teacher will be here tomorrow

1038
00:58:50,364 --> 00:58:52,115
Despite knowing about this place

1039
00:58:52,241 --> 00:58:54,284
...if he is ready to set foot here

1040
00:58:54,326 --> 00:58:55,911
Don't underestimate him

1041
00:58:55,994 --> 00:58:57,538
First let him land up

1042
00:58:57,579 --> 00:58:59,081
After he steps in here

1043
00:58:59,414 --> 00:59:01,667
Let's see if he lasts here
even for half an hour

1044
00:59:12,261 --> 00:59:14,263
You should be in there by 10'o clock

1045
00:59:14,304 --> 00:59:17,349
If you freshen up
I can take you in my car

1046
00:59:19,351 --> 00:59:20,435
In that vehicle?

1047
00:59:20,727 --> 00:59:22,104
- Yes
- Okay, you go

1048
00:59:22,229 --> 00:59:23,981
- I'll take you safe-
- I'll shower and come

1049
00:59:24,022 --> 00:59:25,023
Okay, bro

1050
00:59:27,818 --> 00:59:30,237
Life is a pain, hmmm?

1051
00:59:33,615 --> 00:59:34,658
3 months

1052
00:59:49,131 --> 00:59:51,341
If he comes in and
starts taking a lesson

1053
00:59:51,383 --> 00:59:53,177
...ask all of them
to fling these at him

1054
00:59:54,761 --> 00:59:55,888
Das

1055
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:15,866
"Ooooh yeah
You know who it is!"

1056
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:20,662
"If I'm doin' somethin"

1057
01:00:24,082 --> 01:00:26,627
"Boy...I like to do it well"

1058
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:32,925
"And when I'm in the zone"

1059
01:00:36,178 --> 01:00:38,847
"Ain't nobody stoppin' me"

1060
01:00:43,644 --> 01:00:46,438
"You know who it is"

1061
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:54,029
Das, look at his stride and beard!
Doesn't look like a master

1062
01:00:54,071 --> 01:00:55,697
Doesn't carry a book or a cane

1063
01:00:55,739 --> 01:00:57,366
He looks so local
Rough & tough

1064
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:00,410
We'll provoke him and then pounce

1065
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:11,463
"Master"

1066
01:01:12,256 --> 01:01:14,258
"They call me...master"

1067
01:01:15,092 --> 01:01:17,135
"You know me...master"

1068
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:20,597
"I'm master the blaster"

1069
01:01:21,473 --> 01:01:23,058
"Master"

1070
01:01:23,809 --> 01:01:25,811
"They call me...master"

1071
01:01:26,603 --> 01:01:29,356
"You know me...master"

1072
01:01:30,107 --> 01:01:32,317
"I'm master the blaster"

1073
01:01:33,944 --> 01:01:36,905
"If you step foot in our place
it is trespassing into our space"

1074
01:01:36,947 --> 01:01:39,658
"We will hassle you to the root
Master, change your route"

1075
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,411
"As juveniles we roam
in this Observation Home"

1076
01:01:42,452 --> 01:01:44,913
"Tears in our eyes ready
if you ask us to study"

1077
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,457
"Don't take lessons in life
Or ask us to drop our knife"

1078
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:50,335
"Your lame advice is of no use
We don't want your views"

1079
01:01:50,377 --> 01:01:52,004
"Sir, don't take lessons in life-"

1080
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:54,381
Why did you stop singing?
It was such a peppy song

1081
01:01:56,592 --> 01:01:57,801
Wow!

1082
01:01:57,843 --> 01:01:59,887
Song...sketch

1083
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:02,306
Looks like a bunch of talented boys

1084
01:02:02,347 --> 01:02:03,473
Not bad at all

1085
01:02:04,683 --> 01:02:06,894
Are you setting out to play?

1086
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:08,228
Why?
What's wrong?

1087
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:11,690
I don't interfere in the likes
or dislikes of anyone, boss

1088
01:02:11,732 --> 01:02:14,109
Whoever wants to play, go ahead
Want to sit here, be my guest

1089
01:02:14,151 --> 01:02:16,361
'I am allergic to the sun
I'll sit right here'

1090
01:02:16,945 --> 01:02:18,030
Should I teach now?

1091
01:02:18,113 --> 01:02:20,407
- No...no
- We want to play

1092
01:02:20,949 --> 01:02:21,950
Very good

1093
01:02:22,117 --> 01:02:25,370
- 'I must catch up on Amazon, Netflix'
- Shall we give the letter now, brother?

1094
01:02:25,662 --> 01:02:28,040
'I hate the sight of
this classroom, bench'

1095
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:30,334
- 'I will throw all this out'
- Not now, I'll tell you

1096
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:35,047
Don't indulge in all this graffiti
on the board, bathroom walls

1097
01:02:35,088 --> 01:02:37,299
You focus on your work
and I'll stick to my job

1098
01:02:37,716 --> 01:02:38,717
Deal?

1099
01:02:38,759 --> 01:02:40,886
We thought of chasing you away
if you started lessons today

1100
01:02:41,094 --> 01:02:42,763
You are unique, master

1101
01:02:42,804 --> 01:02:43,972
He seems to be one of us

1102
01:02:44,014 --> 01:02:46,016
Turned out I'm quite jobless

1103
01:02:46,058 --> 01:02:47,476
Why waste time sitting?

1104
01:02:47,601 --> 01:02:52,105
Why is this place so dirty
and stinking to high heaven?

1105
01:02:52,147 --> 01:02:55,776
We celebrate 10 festivals a year
and 20 birthdays of leaders

1106
01:02:55,817 --> 01:02:58,445
You don't clean up this place
and celebrate on any occasion?

1107
01:02:58,487 --> 01:02:59,696
'Celebrate' means?

1108
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:01,865
That means-

1109
01:03:01,907 --> 01:03:02,950
Have a blast, huh?

1110
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:04,034
Right

1111
01:03:04,117 --> 01:03:04,910
Rock on

1112
01:03:05,118 --> 01:03:07,663
We have no idea of day or date
You and your ideas!

1113
01:03:08,205 --> 01:03:09,414
So simple

1114
01:03:09,456 --> 01:03:11,416
Some of you were singing
when I entered, right?

1115
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:13,418
- Who were they?
- I sang

1116
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,587
What the four of you just sang

1117
01:03:15,629 --> 01:03:17,756
If 40 of you sing in chorus

1118
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,216
That's celebration

1119
01:03:20,634 --> 01:03:23,011
Come with me
I'll show you

1120
01:03:31,478 --> 01:03:32,646
Beat it

1121
01:03:41,113 --> 01:03:45,450
"Let me sing a 'kutti' story
Pay attention, listen to me"

1122
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:48,453
Why singing in English, bro?

1123
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:50,414
Just listen, bro

1124
01:03:50,455 --> 01:03:55,085
"Let me sing a short story
Pay attention, listen to me"

1125
01:03:55,169 --> 01:03:59,673
"If you want, take it or else
no need tension, leave it, baby"

1126
01:03:59,715 --> 01:04:06,430
"Life is very short, buddy
Always be happy"

1127
01:04:07,764 --> 01:04:11,435
"100s of problems will come & go"

1128
01:04:11,476 --> 01:04:14,479
"Chill a bit, bro"

1129
01:04:16,398 --> 01:04:17,691
Together, man

1130
01:04:17,774 --> 01:04:22,487
"Let me sing a mini story
Pay attention, listen to me"

1131
01:04:22,613 --> 01:04:27,034
"If you want, take it or else
no tension, leave it, baby"

1132
01:04:27,117 --> 01:04:32,706
"Life is very short, 'nanba'
Always be happy"

1133
01:04:34,082 --> 01:04:38,921
"Problems in many designs will come and go"

1134
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:42,049
"Chillax and relax, bro"

1135
01:04:43,383 --> 01:04:45,260
No tension, baby

1136
01:04:59,107 --> 01:05:03,278
"If you race at a zip zap zoom speed
concentration is a must indeed"

1137
01:05:03,362 --> 01:05:08,200
"If you crawl at a slow pace
to be steady is a must always"

1138
01:05:11,912 --> 01:05:17,292
"Oh! Anger always misery, baby"

1139
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:21,964
"Stand united as friends, powerful, buddy"

1140
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:26,343
"Haters are gonna hate but ignore calmly"

1141
01:05:26,385 --> 01:05:31,056
"Delete negativity totally, baby"

1142
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:35,310
"Focus on what you dream
and don't worry, mApi"

1143
01:05:35,394 --> 01:05:39,731
"Positivity will lift you, baby"

1144
01:05:40,107 --> 01:05:46,238
"Life is very short, buddy
Always be happy"

1145
01:05:48,156 --> 01:05:55,163
"Very many problems will come and go
Don't be tense, chill a bit, bro"

1146
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,083
Students

1147
01:05:58,584 --> 01:06:03,046
"Let me sing a 'kutti' story
Pay attention, listen to me"

1148
01:06:03,088 --> 01:06:07,801
"If you want, take it or else
no need tension, leave it, baby"

1149
01:06:07,843 --> 01:06:13,849
"Life is very short, buddy
Always be happy"

1150
01:06:14,933 --> 01:06:19,396
"Problems in many a hue will come and go"

1151
01:06:19,438 --> 01:06:22,482
"Take a break, bro"

1152
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:25,736
No tension, baby

1153
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:58,101
"Hard work too is necessary
Smart work also is compulsory"

1154
01:06:58,143 --> 01:07:02,940
"Self motivation
Isn't it your reflection?"

1155
01:07:03,023 --> 01:07:07,444
"You need education
Plus total dedication"

1156
01:07:07,486 --> 01:07:11,615
"Try self evaluation
for validation"

1157
01:07:11,657 --> 01:07:16,245
"Don't be the person spreading hatred, mApi"

1158
01:07:16,286 --> 01:07:20,707
"To talk behind one's back is so crappy"

1159
01:07:20,749 --> 01:07:25,045
"Always be polite and just don't be nasty"

1160
01:07:25,337 --> 01:07:29,591
"You be the reason to make someone happy"

1161
01:07:29,967 --> 01:07:36,014
"Life is very short, buddy
Always be happy"

1162
01:07:38,058 --> 01:07:45,232
"Many problems will come and go
Put your feet up, bro"

1163
01:07:46,817 --> 01:07:47,943
One last time

1164
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:52,781
"Let me sing a 'kutti' story
Pay attention, listen to me"

1165
01:07:52,865 --> 01:07:57,286
"If you want, take it or else
no need tension, leave it, baby"

1166
01:07:57,411 --> 01:08:03,417
"Life is very short, buddy
Always be happy"

1167
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:09,089
"Problems in many designs will come and go"

1168
01:08:09,173 --> 01:08:12,718
"Breathe a bit easy, bro"

1169
01:08:14,595 --> 01:08:16,722
"That was my 'kutti' story"

1170
01:08:16,763 --> 01:08:18,891
"How was my short story"

1171
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:21,101
"That was my Lilliput story"

1172
01:08:21,351 --> 01:08:25,355
"How was my 'kutti' story?"

1173
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:32,070
Go...go...go

1174
01:08:37,242 --> 01:08:38,285
Master

1175
01:08:40,245 --> 01:08:41,580
'He's asleep, da?'

1176
01:08:41,997 --> 01:08:43,248
Quick, wake him up

1177
01:08:43,457 --> 01:08:44,458
Sir

1178
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:46,335
Sir

1179
01:08:47,085 --> 01:08:48,212
Sir?

1180
01:08:48,253 --> 01:08:50,422
- Put the letter in his pocket
- He is sleeping, bro

1181
01:08:50,464 --> 01:08:51,798
Just do it

1182
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:58,013
Hey!

1183
01:08:58,055 --> 01:08:59,890
Who is that tickling me?

1184
01:09:00,766 --> 01:09:03,227
I can hear footsteps, we'll talk
to him over the phone tonight

1185
01:09:03,268 --> 01:09:04,353
Come away

1186
01:09:05,103 --> 01:09:06,730
We shouldn't get caught

1187
01:09:12,236 --> 01:09:15,239
Thank God, only another 89 days left

1188
01:09:15,781 --> 01:09:16,907
Go home

1189
01:09:43,141 --> 01:09:44,810
Hello, stop

1190
01:09:45,394 --> 01:09:47,437
I noticed just now

1191
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:50,357
Don't know who played this prank
Why are you riding a cycle?

1192
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:51,775
I can drop you in my car

1193
01:09:51,817 --> 01:09:53,443
That's alright
I can manag-

1194
01:09:53,485 --> 01:09:57,030
I was hoping at least
you will bring about a change

1195
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:58,782
Why? It's all going smooth

1196
01:09:58,866 --> 01:10:00,450
The boys are having fun

1197
01:10:01,118 --> 01:10:03,453
We are submerged in problems

1198
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:06,081
Half the boys are drowning
in a sea of drugs

1199
01:10:06,582 --> 01:10:08,876
Whatever they get
they readily use as weapons

1200
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:11,086
Everyday some boy or the other
twists his arm or ankle

1201
01:10:11,128 --> 01:10:14,047
Why tell me all these tales?
Am I the police or what?

1202
01:10:14,089 --> 01:10:15,465
I'm just a teacher here

1203
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:17,384
Sir, you don't understand

1204
01:10:17,426 --> 01:10:20,095
The police will nab the criminals
Court will punish them

1205
01:10:20,137 --> 01:10:21,305
To guide these boys

1206
01:10:21,346 --> 01:10:23,307
To sift and sieve right from wrong

1207
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:25,684
We are not equipped, sir
They need a master like you

1208
01:10:25,726 --> 01:10:28,312
First understand this is
a reformatory for juvenile delinquents

1209
01:10:28,645 --> 01:10:30,480
'The boys have got into a fist-fight, sir'

1210
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:32,900
'I am unable to control them
Whoever is out there, come in, sir'

1211
01:10:33,108 --> 01:10:34,860
Yov! Wait, man
I am coming in now

1212
01:10:34,902 --> 01:10:37,946
First close A block and
ensure outsiders don't enter

1213
01:10:41,408 --> 01:10:43,202
He isn't picking the phone, da

1214
01:10:44,912 --> 01:10:45,954
'What happened, bro?'

1215
01:10:45,996 --> 01:10:48,290
'I tried 10-15 times
He isn't picking my call'

1216
01:10:48,332 --> 01:10:50,083
'Try again, bro'

1217
01:11:21,156 --> 01:11:22,699
'He isn't picking our call'

1218
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:25,452
'Do you remember sister Charu's number?'

1219
01:11:25,953 --> 01:11:27,287
'Call her, bro'

1220
01:11:27,663 --> 01:11:28,664
'Hurry up'

1221
01:11:30,666 --> 01:11:33,168
Manikandan speaking, sister
You saw me in the Observation Home

1222
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:34,461
Someone is coming

1223
01:11:34,503 --> 01:11:36,171
- Switch off the phone
- 'Hello...hello?'

1224
01:11:36,213 --> 01:11:37,464
'Can you hear me, Mani?'

1225
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:38,632
Go, brother

1226
01:12:18,338 --> 01:12:19,673
Enjoy the 'biriyani'

1227
01:12:20,757 --> 01:12:22,009
'Brother...?'

1228
01:12:22,467 --> 01:12:24,720
- We don't want
- Why?

1229
01:12:24,761 --> 01:12:26,221
Not hungry

1230
01:12:26,638 --> 01:12:27,681
Is that so?

1231
01:12:28,974 --> 01:12:30,475
He asked you to eat, right?

1232
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:35,063
Half baked nutcase!

1233
01:12:37,024 --> 01:12:40,319
How much we have suffered,
starving in this same spot, moron

1234
01:12:42,905 --> 01:12:44,239
Get me some water

1235
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:47,159
Bro, I'm scared-

1236
01:12:47,201 --> 01:12:49,453
Lucky to get a leg piece in a 'biriyani'

1237
01:12:52,289 --> 01:12:54,041
You can even kill someone

1238
01:12:54,374 --> 01:12:55,876
But not rob him of food

1239
01:12:56,793 --> 01:12:58,003
Go on, eat

1240
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:06,136
Water

1241
01:13:08,138 --> 01:13:09,139
Enough

1242
01:13:14,394 --> 01:13:17,105
They took my phone though
they knew very well it was mine

1243
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:23,153
Whom did you call?

1244
01:13:23,237 --> 01:13:24,613
No one, bro

1245
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,241
Don't know

1246
01:13:27,366 --> 01:13:28,450
Tell me the truth

1247
01:13:29,117 --> 01:13:30,160
I don't know, bro

1248
01:13:30,369 --> 01:13:32,204
Ma...master, bro

1249
01:13:32,371 --> 01:13:33,580
Who?

1250
01:13:33,664 --> 01:13:35,415
The master who joined duty

1251
01:13:35,457 --> 01:13:38,001
- Master, huh?
- He's a boozer, bro

1252
01:13:38,043 --> 01:13:40,212
You don't have to take him
seriously at all, bro

1253
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:44,049
Why, 'master'?

1254
01:13:44,091 --> 01:13:45,968
My father died
when I was a kid

1255
01:13:46,009 --> 01:13:48,762
Couldn't bear the hunger
I stole and got caught

1256
01:13:48,929 --> 01:13:51,098
They piled cases on me

1257
01:13:51,139 --> 01:13:53,976
And sent me to this
Ju...Juvenile Home, bro

1258
01:13:54,017 --> 01:13:55,644
We are being released tomorrow

1259
01:13:55,686 --> 01:13:59,481
But he is asking me to surrender
for a murder case, bro

1260
01:13:59,606 --> 01:14:02,985
If my mother gets to know this
she will die of shock, bro

1261
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:08,740
If you had called me
instead of calling that master

1262
01:14:08,782 --> 01:14:10,450
I'm emotional by nature you see

1263
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:12,911
I would have assigned
someone else to surrender

1264
01:14:13,412 --> 01:14:15,789
Not wanting to surrender
isn't a mistake on your part

1265
01:14:15,831 --> 01:14:17,958
But you wanted to sneak
our internal information

1266
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,710
Isn't that a grave mistake?

1267
01:14:20,794 --> 01:14:23,046
Grown-up boy, you tell me
What you did was wrong or not?

1268
01:14:23,088 --> 01:14:25,132
- Yes, it was wrong
- So I am right?

1269
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:28,886
Enough of eating 'biriyani'

1270
01:14:28,927 --> 01:14:31,388
I'll take it
You've had enough

1271
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:32,472
Here, take this

1272
01:14:32,598 --> 01:14:34,933
Aren't we both very young, bro?

1273
01:14:34,975 --> 01:14:37,853
Think of us as your younger brother
and please forgive us this time

1274
01:14:37,895 --> 01:14:41,023
My dear, only boys like you
should not be pardoned

1275
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:44,109
They pardoned me
Look how it has shaped me

1276
01:14:44,484 --> 01:14:45,819
How do we deal with this?

1277
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:48,739
We won't repeat this, bro
We won't snitch to anyone

1278
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:53,160
Listen, you can be scared
of anyone in this world

1279
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,454
But if death knocks at our door

1280
01:14:55,746 --> 01:14:57,748
...even if it is Lord Yama
you shouldn't be scared

1281
01:14:59,917 --> 01:15:01,418
I'll give you 2 minutes

1282
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:04,922
Kill me and then save
your brother and yourself

1283
01:15:07,299 --> 01:15:10,177
What were you doing
when these kids stole your phone?

1284
01:15:10,219 --> 01:15:12,054
On top of it you have
this stuck up attitude!

1285
01:15:12,095 --> 01:15:13,722
- Go away
- I won't leave you

1286
01:15:13,764 --> 01:15:15,474
Listen to me
Just run away

1287
01:15:15,599 --> 01:15:16,725
- Run outside
- I won't go

1288
01:15:16,767 --> 01:15:19,061
Mess up all my orders
Only plus is your voice!

1289
01:15:19,102 --> 01:15:19,895
I won't go

1290
01:15:20,103 --> 01:15:21,855
You have only 1 minute left

1291
01:15:21,897 --> 01:15:23,023
Decide fast

1292
01:15:23,065 --> 01:15:24,066
Go away from here

1293
01:15:24,107 --> 01:15:26,360
I won't leave you alone

1294
01:15:35,869 --> 01:15:37,120
'What are you doing?'

1295
01:15:37,579 --> 01:15:38,580
'Don't, bro'

1296
01:15:39,915 --> 01:15:41,834
This is what I expected from you!

1297
01:15:43,085 --> 01:15:44,294
Clear out

1298
01:15:44,336 --> 01:15:46,046
I won't leave you

1299
01:15:55,013 --> 01:15:57,349
Brother...!

1300
01:15:58,433 --> 01:16:00,394
Wake up, bro
Get up

1301
01:16:00,435 --> 01:16:03,021
I'm constable Arumugam
Get up, bro

1302
01:16:03,063 --> 01:16:05,691
School starts only at 10'o clock
Why are you waking me-

1303
01:16:05,732 --> 01:16:08,026
We have a problem on hand
Inspector wants to see you

1304
01:16:08,068 --> 01:16:09,903
Why should I meet the inspector?

1305
01:16:09,945 --> 01:16:12,406
You have to get up now
Not realizing the gravity of the situ-

1306
01:16:12,447 --> 01:16:13,782
Okay, I'll get up

1307
01:16:13,866 --> 01:16:15,450
Don't shake me up like a rattle!

1308
01:16:16,118 --> 01:16:17,369
Go, I'll follow

1309
01:16:18,871 --> 01:16:20,038
'I will come'

1310
01:16:21,456 --> 01:16:24,626
"You say you heard a rumor"

1311
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:28,630
"And it's time I let you know"

1312
01:16:28,714 --> 01:16:30,007
Start...make it quick

1313
01:16:31,383 --> 01:16:34,636
"You won't need, won't need no ruler"

1314
01:16:57,659 --> 01:17:02,915
"If delinquents like us lament in pain
will our voice be heard; or is it in vain?"

1315
01:17:03,624 --> 01:17:04,917
'Not too sure, sir'

1316
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:06,752
'I think they were here
for less than a year'

1317
01:17:07,753 --> 01:17:11,798
"2 innocent boys here
Lost their lives so dear"

1318
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,300
'I am in the crime spot, sir'

1319
01:17:13,342 --> 01:17:16,094
"To reside here or hang by a rope
One and the same without hope"

1320
01:17:16,136 --> 01:17:18,180
'What are you gawking at, huh?'

1321
01:17:18,222 --> 01:17:19,348
Yov! Who are you?

1322
01:17:19,389 --> 01:17:20,599
- Get out
- Sir...sir

1323
01:17:20,641 --> 01:17:21,892
He is our class master

1324
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:25,062
Oh! You are that master, huh?
First I have to interrogate you

1325
01:17:25,103 --> 01:17:26,313
What did you do?

1326
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:27,814
This has never happened before

1327
01:17:27,898 --> 01:17:29,274
Did you hit any of the boys?

1328
01:17:29,316 --> 01:17:30,359
Tell me

1329
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,152
Can't you hear me?
Answer, man

1330
01:17:33,654 --> 01:17:36,031
Sir, what is this?

1331
01:17:36,114 --> 01:17:37,866
Not here, I need to
take him for inquiry

1332
01:17:37,908 --> 01:17:39,910
'Get him into our police jeep'

1333
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:43,163
'Search all the rooms in case
they left any suicide note'

1334
01:17:43,622 --> 01:17:47,751
"We want to reform given a choice
We are good-for-nothing boys"

1335
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:54,174
"If delinquents like us lament in pain
will our voice be heard; or is it in vain?"

1336
01:17:58,387 --> 01:18:03,767
"If good-for-nothing louts wail
will our voice make justice prevail?"

1337
01:18:06,353 --> 01:18:08,188
'N2 Police Station
Vadaseri'

1338
01:18:17,614 --> 01:18:20,158
Bhavani, can we come with you?

1339
01:18:20,742 --> 01:18:22,953
He has asked me to come
by myself, I can handle it

1340
01:18:22,995 --> 01:18:25,455
What about...that master
who is in police custody?

1341
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:30,460
I came out of the reformatory 15 years ago

1342
01:18:30,586 --> 01:18:32,421
Reason I've been patient
for the past 5 years

1343
01:18:32,462 --> 01:18:36,258
I wanted to kill these 3 men and
become the president of the Drivers' union

1344
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:39,178
2 men are dead and gone
This is the last one to go down

1345
01:18:39,219 --> 01:18:40,387
He has sent for me

1346
01:18:40,971 --> 01:18:42,264
Is he my priority?

1347
01:18:43,056 --> 01:18:44,725
Or is this master important?

1348
01:18:44,766 --> 01:18:45,934
He's only important

1349
01:18:45,976 --> 01:18:47,895
- What shall we do with this master?
- I'll handle him

1350
01:18:48,103 --> 01:18:50,147
- Sure?
- No problem

1351
01:18:50,189 --> 01:18:52,065
- Shall I go now?
- I'll go

1352
01:18:53,108 --> 01:18:54,359
Let's go

1353
01:19:00,616 --> 01:19:01,950
Come with me

1354
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:10,959
Where are you going?

1355
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:13,462
- 2 minutes, sir
- Quick, sir will be here anytime

1356
01:19:13,587 --> 01:19:15,422
'Are you the mother of
those 2 boys who died?'

1357
01:19:15,464 --> 01:19:17,382
- 'Yes, sir
- Is that so?'

1358
01:19:17,716 --> 01:19:18,926
'Give him all the details'

1359
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:20,385
Boozed upto your brow, huh?

1360
01:19:20,427 --> 01:19:23,096
- 'Sit outside
- Okay, sir'

1361
01:19:23,889 --> 01:19:26,058
If someone is calling you
10 times from the same number

1362
01:19:26,099 --> 01:19:28,393
...won't it occur to you
it may be a serious problem?

1363
01:19:28,435 --> 01:19:30,604
No, Ch...Charu

1364
01:19:31,188 --> 01:19:32,439
Why are you staring so blankly?

1365
01:19:32,481 --> 01:19:35,150
I was a volunteer in an NGO
before I took up this post here

1366
01:19:35,984 --> 01:19:39,238
Based on a complaint I went
for inspection to that Observation Home

1367
01:19:39,738 --> 01:19:42,115
That's how I befriended those 2 boys

1368
01:19:43,116 --> 01:19:45,702
They told me about the injustice
in that reformatory

1369
01:19:46,119 --> 01:19:48,830
But I couldn't take
any legal action

1370
01:19:48,872 --> 01:19:50,123
So many vile threats

1371
01:19:50,165 --> 01:19:53,043
The only reason I shifted to Chennai
was to handle such cases myself

1372
01:19:53,085 --> 01:19:56,255
I needed to be financially secure
So I took up this lecturer's post

1373
01:19:57,089 --> 01:20:00,300
When you defended the students
my faith was recharged

1374
01:20:01,134 --> 01:20:04,054
I was convinced this flawed system
could be changed for the better

1375
01:20:06,473 --> 01:20:08,433
I forged your signature for this post

1376
01:20:08,475 --> 01:20:10,644
Even for your job
I was the one who applied

1377
01:20:11,061 --> 01:20:12,855
Even the founder is aware of this

1378
01:20:12,896 --> 01:20:14,857
Now I feel that was a big mistake

1379
01:20:16,817 --> 01:20:20,654
If you hadn't come here
at least those 2 boys would be alive

1380
01:20:22,406 --> 01:20:24,366
Now both of them have left us

1381
01:20:24,408 --> 01:20:26,118
How can you defend yourself, sir?

1382
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:34,835
See, I had no idea whatsoever
No one told me anything

1383
01:20:34,877 --> 01:20:37,004
When have you been
sober enough to understand?

1384
01:20:37,045 --> 01:20:40,424
Have you ever realized anytime
who is talking to you?

1385
01:20:44,052 --> 01:20:46,180
I have my share of personal problems

1386
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:48,056
I am unable to come out of it

1387
01:20:48,891 --> 01:20:50,017
I can't

1388
01:20:50,684 --> 01:20:51,894
...cry

1389
01:20:52,477 --> 01:20:55,147
I can't cry, I can't sleep
at night either, that's why

1390
01:20:58,650 --> 01:20:59,818
I drink

1391
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:03,030
I swear I never thought
it would be this horrific

1392
01:21:03,697 --> 01:21:06,116
Oh! You can never cry, right?

1393
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,410
'I can't understand
'Tell me without crying'

1394
01:21:08,452 --> 01:21:09,661
Charu, where are yo-

1395
01:21:09,745 --> 01:21:12,789
- Were your boys into drugs?
- I never thought I would see them dead

1396
01:21:12,831 --> 01:21:15,584
This is the lady who gave birth
to those boys who are dead now

1397
01:21:15,626 --> 01:21:16,919
I had reassured her

1398
01:21:17,085 --> 01:21:18,253
A master will come

1399
01:21:18,295 --> 01:21:20,297
'He will save your boys'

1400
01:21:21,048 --> 01:21:25,052
Both my sons are very fond of each other
They stick together like glue

1401
01:21:25,969 --> 01:21:28,430
My eldest told me
just last week

1402
01:21:28,472 --> 01:21:32,059
'Let my younger brother study
I'll find some job to support us'

1403
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,894
'A master was coming he said'

1404
01:21:34,102 --> 01:21:36,730
He was sure they will be rescued

1405
01:21:37,022 --> 01:21:38,982
But no one came

1406
01:21:39,149 --> 01:21:41,985
'My entire lineage has snapped'

1407
01:21:42,611 --> 01:21:44,446
Yov! Where are you?

1408
01:21:44,488 --> 01:21:45,614
Hurry up

1409
01:21:46,490 --> 01:21:47,699
'Listen to him'

1410
01:21:48,033 --> 01:21:49,201
Bring your wife

1411
01:21:49,243 --> 01:21:52,037
- Yov! Come here
- You can go

1412
01:21:52,204 --> 01:21:53,830
'He has gone back to his old ways'

1413
01:21:53,872 --> 01:21:56,041
- Sir
- Who are they?

1414
01:21:56,083 --> 01:21:58,377
She is that master's colleague it seems

1415
01:21:58,418 --> 01:22:00,462
Pack them all off and
move that master to the cell

1416
01:22:00,587 --> 01:22:01,588
Okay, sir

1417
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:03,966
Yov! Clear the other cases
out of the station

1418
01:22:04,007 --> 01:22:05,008
Okay, sir

1419
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:06,635
'What will I do now?'

1420
01:22:07,344 --> 01:22:08,971
'How will I live without them?'

1421
01:22:09,012 --> 01:22:10,806
'Even now you're so hard hearted?'

1422
01:22:10,848 --> 01:22:12,933
Your eyes won't shed tears
till the day you die

1423
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,393
Get even more sloshed

1424
01:22:14,434 --> 01:22:16,979
'Why are you lamenting here?
Shut up now'

1425
01:22:17,062 --> 01:22:18,063
I said shut up

1426
01:22:18,772 --> 01:22:21,650
Do I have to repeat myself?
Clear this place now, madam

1427
01:22:21,692 --> 01:22:22,776
Clear out

1428
01:22:23,068 --> 01:22:24,194
Come with me, sir

1429
01:22:24,945 --> 01:22:26,029
I swear-

1430
01:22:26,029 --> 01:22:28,407
Come along, sir
Standing rooted to the spot

1431
01:22:28,448 --> 01:22:30,450
I swear I didn't expect any of this

1432
01:22:30,617 --> 01:22:33,453
Don't forget you are also responsible
for the death of those 2 boys

1433
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:35,289
Convey my apologies to their mother

1434
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:37,916
You are taking undue advantage
of the respect I'm giving you

1435
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:40,085
Don't make me lose my temper
Stand right there

1436
01:22:40,752 --> 01:22:42,880
I sacrificed my children
in such an awful unjust way

1437
01:22:43,088 --> 01:22:44,798
'Hey! Come here'

1438
01:22:55,142 --> 01:22:56,268
Go inside

1439
01:23:06,695 --> 01:23:09,281
- 'You want a mosquito repellent!
- Don't hit, it hurts'

1440
01:23:22,419 --> 01:23:24,129
Listen, Bhavani

1441
01:23:24,171 --> 01:23:28,258
Only you and I are left to contest
the Lorry Drivers' Union election

1442
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,052
I have to win unopposed

1443
01:23:30,093 --> 01:23:31,595
'Looks like it may rain'

1444
01:23:31,637 --> 01:23:33,305
Can we have tea
and then discuss?

1445
01:23:42,481 --> 01:23:43,649
[sniffles]

1446
01:24:00,666 --> 01:24:03,377
'Master, my name is Sabari'

1447
01:24:03,418 --> 01:24:05,254
'My elder brother is Manikandan'

1448
01:24:05,295 --> 01:24:09,258
'He stole from a bakery for my sake
because I was starving'

1449
01:24:09,675 --> 01:24:13,136
'But they foisted some other case
on us and brought us here'

1450
01:24:13,804 --> 01:24:15,681
'Everything is wrong here, master'

1451
01:24:16,056 --> 01:24:17,766
'They thrash us mercilessly'

1452
01:24:17,975 --> 01:24:20,102
'They stuff some powder into our mouths'

1453
01:24:20,644 --> 01:24:24,273
'Immediately even our teeth
start shivering, master'

1454
01:24:24,857 --> 01:24:27,192
'Don't know if it is day or night'

1455
01:24:27,943 --> 01:24:31,029
'We put up with all this
thinking it is for a short period'

1456
01:24:31,113 --> 01:24:32,656
'Now when we are
about to be released'

1457
01:24:32,698 --> 01:24:34,950
'...they want us to surrender
for some other murder case'

1458
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:38,370
'Otherwise they are threatening
to kill our mother, master'

1459
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:42,833
'Sister Charu assured us you will come
and be our savior, rescue us'

1460
01:24:43,834 --> 01:24:45,335
'Please save us, master'

1461
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:47,629
'Our poor mother'

1462
01:24:47,713 --> 01:24:49,256
'She is all alone'

1463
01:24:49,298 --> 01:24:51,008
'Crying nonstop daily'

1464
01:24:51,383 --> 01:24:53,218
'I can't cry anymore, master'

1465
01:24:53,886 --> 01:24:56,221
'Please, brother
Rescue us from this hell'

1466
01:24:56,889 --> 01:24:58,765
'I am begging you, brother'

1467
01:25:19,244 --> 01:25:20,245
Go ahead

1468
01:25:21,163 --> 01:25:22,789
I told you, Bhavani

1469
01:25:22,831 --> 01:25:24,249
I want to win unopposed

1470
01:25:24,291 --> 01:25:26,627
I called you here
to arrive at a compromise

1471
01:25:26,668 --> 01:25:28,295
But still I can't trust you

1472
01:25:29,338 --> 01:25:34,051
You'll take any kind of cruel measure
using those juvenile delinquents

1473
01:25:34,218 --> 01:25:39,097
Should I step out of my house daily
with fear in every breath I exhale?

1474
01:25:41,141 --> 01:25:42,184
That is why-

1475
01:25:42,226 --> 01:25:45,103
Did you call me here
planning to kill me?

1476
01:25:47,606 --> 01:25:48,732
You-

1477
01:25:48,774 --> 01:25:50,901
You call someone
with a plan to kill him

1478
01:25:50,984 --> 01:25:53,612
Treat him royally like a guest
and offer him hot tea

1479
01:25:53,654 --> 01:25:56,740
You're the only man who
asked me for permission to kill

1480
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:58,784
Instead you could have-

1481
01:25:58,867 --> 01:26:02,371
Putting you on a pedestal, I wanted to
fix an auspicious day to finish you off

1482
01:26:02,412 --> 01:26:04,414
I need my brain examined!

1483
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:08,293
'Hey! Wait'

1484
01:26:09,086 --> 01:26:10,796
I'll give you 2 minutes

1485
01:26:12,214 --> 01:26:14,967
Kill me and then save
your men and yourself

1486
01:26:37,197 --> 01:26:38,490
'Hurry up'

1487
01:26:40,742 --> 01:26:42,870
Do you need an army
to bash up 1 man?

1488
01:26:43,453 --> 01:26:44,872
Open the door first

1489
01:27:26,872 --> 01:27:28,457
Hey, he is a master
Watch your blows

1490
01:27:28,582 --> 01:27:29,875
You have only 10 minutes

1491
01:27:29,917 --> 01:27:31,585
Come out without too much damage

1492
01:27:32,711 --> 01:27:33,837
Turn the other way

1493
01:27:34,046 --> 01:27:35,380
[indistinct]

1494
01:27:37,382 --> 01:27:38,675
Come, Murali

1495
01:27:38,717 --> 01:27:40,052
Switch it off and come

1496
01:28:04,785 --> 01:28:07,287
Even if you are reborn
pray I don't set eyes on you!

1497
01:28:07,371 --> 01:28:09,164
Don't, Bhavani

1498
01:28:18,841 --> 01:28:20,425
Wonder what their plan is!

1499
01:28:21,009 --> 01:28:24,221
Master, my boss has
given you a bus ticket

1500
01:28:24,263 --> 01:28:26,682
'Luxury bus
Air-condition sleeper'

1501
01:28:26,723 --> 01:28:29,184
Leave tonight, you'll reach
your hometown in the morning

'If you stubbornly refuse'

1507
01:28:33,021 --> 01:28:34,606
You saw the 2 boys
hanging from the roof?

1508
01:28:34,648 --> 01:28:36,149
You'll be next

1509
01:28:37,109 --> 01:28:38,485
I'm talking to you

1510
01:28:38,610 --> 01:28:40,237
Is that a love letter in your hand?

1511
01:28:42,364 --> 01:28:44,449
Sabari, Manikandan

1512
01:28:44,449 --> 01:28:46,785
[reading under his breath]

1513
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:51,081
Refusing to surrender in the murder case
and ended up dead, those 2 tramps-

1514
01:29:38,295 --> 01:29:40,839
Sir, the noise is too loud

1515
01:29:42,216 --> 01:29:43,884
Ignore, we'll handle it

1516
01:30:21,296 --> 01:30:23,048
Sir, the noise is ear-splitting

1517
01:30:23,715 --> 01:30:25,217
- Go in and check
- Okay

1518
01:30:45,112 --> 01:30:47,447
'Stab him and rip him apart'

1519
01:30:54,121 --> 01:30:55,122
Sir?

1520
01:30:55,455 --> 01:30:58,041
They may kill that master
Please come here, sir

1521
01:31:06,425 --> 01:31:07,593
Yov Soundar!

1522
01:31:12,181 --> 01:31:13,765
Open the damn door

1523
01:31:24,234 --> 01:31:25,444
Soundar

1524
01:31:46,089 --> 01:31:47,633
- Tell me
- BHAVANI!

1525
01:31:48,926 --> 01:31:52,262
The master-

1526
01:31:58,227 --> 01:31:59,645
Who are you?

1527
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:02,356
Who is behind this?
What is your motive?

1528
01:32:02,397 --> 01:32:05,317
Why do you use these innocent boys?
I don't know any of this

1529
01:32:06,818 --> 01:32:08,153
But I will find out

1530
01:32:09,112 --> 01:32:12,032
'Hiding behind these boys and
framing them, neck deep in crime'

1531
01:32:12,115 --> 01:32:14,034
I will catch those sissy fellows

1532
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:18,372
I'll hunt high and low, find you
and stand right in front of you

1533
01:32:19,081 --> 01:32:20,374
I will-

1534
01:32:24,086 --> 01:32:28,090
I will make you answer
for the death of those 2 boys

1535
01:32:29,967 --> 01:32:31,093
Master

1536
01:32:32,010 --> 01:32:34,721
Whatever I'm about to say
is nothing new for you

1537
01:32:36,098 --> 01:32:38,267
Still I'll say it
and you listen

1538
01:32:41,353 --> 01:32:42,354
I'm waiting!

1539

01:32:47,609 --> 01:32:48,610
Wait, I say

1541
01:32:48,652 --> 01:32:49,987
I will meet you face to face

1542
01:32:50,028 --> 01:32:51,280
"He stands for powerful victory"

1543
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:52,739

- Thalapathy...!"

1544
01:33:10,007 --> 01:33:11,925
'Das, I'm very scared'

1545
01:33:11,967 --> 01:33:14,344
'He is back again
Is there no one to save me?'

1546
01:33:14,386 --> 01:33:15,971
'Aiyaiyo!

1547
01:33:16,013 --> 01:33:18,640
"Don't spoil for a fight unnecessarily"

1548
01:33:18,682 --> 01:33:21,685
"If you give us hell foolhardily
a stone will split your skull speedily"

1549
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:24,354
Master, you've been staring
at the rope for a long time?

1550
01:33:24,396 --> 01:33:25,647
Want to play on it as a swing?

1551
01:33:25,689 --> 01:33:27,441
What is that famous song of his?

1552
01:33:27,441 --> 01:33:29,318
Let me tell a 'kutti' story

1553
01:33:29,359 --> 01:33:30,903
Hey chee chee!
Not short, da

1554
01:33:30,944 --> 01:33:32,237
Sad story!

1555
01:33:32,321 --> 01:33:34,406
"Let me tell a sad story"

1556
01:33:34,448 --> 01:33:37,117
"Zip lip, or slip
Skip and trip"

1557
01:33:37,159 --> 01:33:39,119
"Chillax, master!"

1558
01:33:41,288 --> 01:33:43,290
"Take a deep breath, master"

1559
01:33:43,332 --> 01:33:44,833
Hey master!

1560
01:33:45,167 --> 01:33:47,085
"Cheers to your beers!"

1561
01:33:54,551 --> 01:33:57,596
'Youths to the youngest ones
are doped day and night, bro'

1562
01:33:58,096 --> 01:34:00,849
'When they are intoxicated
they are not in control of their senses'

1563
01:34:00,891 --> 01:34:03,268
'Both have plenty of
criminal cases against them'

1564
01:34:03,310 --> 01:34:04,895
'2 boys who died are sheer poison'

1565
01:34:04,937 --> 01:34:06,897
'Both must have died
when totally tanked, sir'

1566
01:34:06,939 --> 01:34:09,441
'They won't toe the line with
their parents or with our rules'

1567
01:34:09,483 --> 01:34:11,485
They are arrogant boys
who insist their word is law

1568
01:34:11,568 --> 01:34:14,112
'There are 10-12 year olds
with all kinds of diseases in here'

1569
01:34:14,154 --> 01:34:15,280
All dazed and doped

1570
01:34:15,322 --> 01:34:18,283
Who told you they were
good-for-nothing boys?

1571
01:34:18,325 --> 01:34:20,118
Both are 24 carat gold, sir

1572
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,079
Both those boys who died

1573
01:34:22,287 --> 01:34:24,831
They called a girl I know
on the night they died

1574
01:34:24,873 --> 01:34:26,041
You mean Charu?

1575
01:34:26,583 --> 01:34:28,085
Yes, Charu

1576
01:34:28,126 --> 01:34:31,338
I know Charu and I know
who killed those 2 boys too

1577
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:33,131
We have tried our level best

1578
01:34:33,173 --> 01:34:36,343
But we are unable to stop
the dope and booze supply

1579
01:34:36,385 --> 01:34:39,263
How can drugs enter the premises
without your knowledge, sir?

1580
01:34:40,305 --> 01:34:43,308
They have so many routes to supply, sir

1581
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:45,102
Without the wardens' support

1582
01:34:45,185 --> 01:34:47,062
'...nothing can be brought in, sir'

1583
01:34:47,104 --> 01:34:50,357
As per our rule book, no violence on
our boys who are all below 18 here

1584
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:52,901
Using that as an excuse
they will bring the roof down!

1585
01:34:52,943 --> 01:34:54,862
Presuming others' fears are their plus

1586
01:34:54,903 --> 01:34:56,655
...these are riff-raffs
who rule the roost

1587
01:34:57,614 --> 01:35:00,534
Poor chaps! Trapped for life
caught in Bhavani's web

1588
01:35:01,493 --> 01:35:02,578
Who is Bhavani?

1589
01:35:03,161 --> 01:35:04,162
Beast!

1590
01:35:04,204 --> 01:35:07,040
- Bhava...Bhavani?
- Don't know anyone by that name

1591
01:35:11,378 --> 01:35:14,214
Sir, don't simply keep asking questions

1592
01:35:14,256 --> 01:35:16,633
You got any other work,
carry on, okay?

1593
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,010
See you, sir?

1594
01:35:18,051 --> 01:35:19,219
Let's go

1595
01:35:47,915 --> 01:35:50,209
'Teachers who came here earlier
to reform these boys'

1596
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:53,295
...would have made a hasty retreat
thinking their family takes priority

1597
01:35:54,546 --> 01:35:56,340
But my story is completely different

1598
01:35:56,965 --> 01:35:58,675
I have no one to call my own, sir

1599
01:36:00,093 --> 01:36:03,847
'The day I saw those 2 boys
hang right in front of my eyes'

1600
01:36:05,307 --> 01:36:06,934
Their eyes bulging

1601
01:36:07,559 --> 01:36:08,977
Tongues sticking out

1602
01:36:10,229 --> 01:36:11,480
I died, sir

1603
01:36:14,942 --> 01:36:16,109
If you can help me

1604
01:36:16,318 --> 01:36:18,820
I will change this place and
bring order and fair play here

1605
01:36:20,155 --> 01:36:22,950
Whatever hardship comes my way
I don't care even if I lose my life

1606
01:36:22,991 --> 01:36:24,117
"My life's breath"

1607
01:36:24,284 --> 01:36:25,410
I have no problem, sir

1608
01:36:25,452 --> 01:36:29,081
If you stick to rules & regulations here,
even move heaven and earth legally

1609
01:36:29,206 --> 01:36:30,624
I will back you up 100%, sir

1610
01:36:30,666 --> 01:36:34,127
"High time I stop needing a high from you"

1611
01:36:35,170 --> 01:36:41,093
"Enough of (s)tumbling thanks to you!"

1612
01:36:41,301 --> 01:36:46,348
"Today my troubled times will heal anew"

1613
01:36:47,349 --> 01:36:50,644
"Enough of being sloshed night & day
Get it out of your system today"

1614
01:36:50,686 --> 01:36:53,856
"Enough of gifting yourself strife
Switch off this dizzying life"

1615
01:36:53,897 --> 01:36:56,942
"No more booze to give a kick
Quit now, double quick"

1616
01:36:56,984 --> 01:37:00,195
"Break the bottles, you surely should
Trash them for your own good"

1617
01:37:00,237 --> 01:37:04,324
"Enough of being drunk as a skunk
Get it out of your system as junk"

1618
01:37:04,867 --> 01:37:06,243
Forgive me, ma

1619
01:37:06,368 --> 01:37:09,413
"No more daily booze session
Quit this deadly addiction"

1620
01:37:09,454 --> 01:37:12,791
"Break this habit, begin life anew
Trash the bottles now, dude"

1621
01:37:12,833 --> 01:37:15,502
"Enough of this, night & day
Get it out of your system today"

1622
01:37:15,544 --> 01:37:18,630
"Enough of this dependence
Switch off without a fuss"

1623
01:37:18,672 --> 01:37:21,800
"Enough of being a slave to craving
Quit drinking; no more depraving"

1624
01:37:21,842 --> 01:37:26,054
"Break the bottles and the habit
Trash them for your own benefit"

1625
01:37:49,411 --> 01:37:50,954
You got me wrong, Bhavani

1626
01:37:50,996 --> 01:37:52,539
Ever since Gurumurthy died

1627
01:37:52,581 --> 01:37:54,791
...everyone is scared
to contest for that post

1628
01:37:55,375 --> 01:37:57,044
I've spoken to the district councilor

1629
01:37:57,085 --> 01:37:58,295
In another 10 days

1630
01:37:58,337 --> 01:38:00,506
...it will be announced
you won unopposed

1631
01:38:00,547 --> 01:38:01,548
Come here

1632
01:38:02,174 --> 01:38:04,343
Bro, she is the one
putting a spoke in the wheel

1633
01:38:04,384 --> 01:38:07,054
She registered the case it seems
Our boys sent her photo just now

1634
01:38:07,095 --> 01:38:08,555
What should we do with her?

1635
01:38:08,597 --> 01:38:10,390
Can't you handle a female?

1636
01:38:10,974 --> 01:38:13,644
As if you need a priest to choose
an auspicious time! Get lost!

1637
01:38:14,645 --> 01:38:17,481
Bhavani, even if someone else
occupies this post as union leader

1638
01:38:17,481 --> 01:38:20,984
Anyway whatever you say will be law
Then why aspire for this post?

1639
01:38:21,068 --> 01:38:23,612
Fear stemming out of murder is short lived

1640
01:38:23,654 --> 01:38:26,949
But fear derived from a post of power
and authority lasts a lifetime, right?

1641
01:38:27,783 --> 01:38:29,660
After this I'm entering politics

1642
01:38:29,993 --> 01:38:32,496
Don't know how many heads will roll
to make that dream come true

1643
01:38:32,538 --> 01:38:34,623
I don't get it, Bhavani

1644
01:38:34,665 --> 01:38:36,500
Our boys will shoulder the sin

1645
01:38:45,843 --> 01:38:48,387
"They call me master
Changes will happen faster"

1646
01:39:22,004 --> 01:39:23,172
Hey master!

1647
01:39:23,213 --> 01:39:25,549
- 'Looking tip-top like a new groom?
- Correct, man'

1648
01:39:25,591 --> 01:39:27,050
He looks different, right?

1649
01:39:27,092 --> 01:39:29,094
'Master is in a mood
to teach us a lesson'

1650
01:39:29,136 --> 01:39:30,554
Do you think he's married?

1651
01:39:30,596 --> 01:39:32,097
'If he was married'

1652
01:39:32,139 --> 01:39:33,557
And if his wife looks hot

1653
01:39:33,599 --> 01:39:34,850
Soooper, no?!??

1654
01:39:36,059 --> 01:39:37,686
All of you stand height-wise

1655
01:39:38,687 --> 01:39:40,230
Shorter ones in front

1656
01:39:40,314 --> 01:39:42,316
Taller ones in the back
Come on, fast

1657
01:39:42,357 --> 01:39:45,819
If you come clean shaven and yell
you think we'll get scared?

1658
01:39:45,819 --> 01:39:49,031
- 'Move on to your next job
- At least pretend to be scared'

1659
01:39:49,114 --> 01:39:50,240
Poor master!

1660
01:39:50,282 --> 01:39:52,201
Let me repeat

1661
01:39:52,284 --> 01:39:53,535
Fall in line
Stand height-wise

1662
01:39:53,577 --> 01:39:57,664
Master, don't judge a book by its cover
Instead of height try weight as a measure

1663
01:39:57,789 --> 01:39:59,374
This chap like a buffalo here

1664
01:39:59,416 --> 01:40:01,460
'Pickpocket case
Real pipsqueak'

1665
01:40:01,502 --> 01:40:04,254
But our little black ant
had the guts to kill

1666
01:40:04,296 --> 01:40:06,298
Cut above the rest
Then isn't he the heaviest?

1667
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:08,217
What is your name?

1668
01:40:08,258 --> 01:40:10,219
You heard me?
What is your name?

1669
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:12,012
Master, you can't lay a finger on us

1670
01:40:12,054 --> 01:40:13,305
Know that, right?

1671
01:40:13,347 --> 01:40:16,600
Sir, you can't lay a finger on the boys

1672
01:40:16,642 --> 01:40:17,643
Rules

1673
01:40:18,477 --> 01:40:21,188
'Don't hit them and
get caught unnecessarily'

1674
01:40:22,189 --> 01:40:25,567
'Like a new starched shirt,
sir is all stiff and spruced up'

1675
01:40:25,609 --> 01:40:27,110
"Master's raid beginning"

1676
01:40:27,152 --> 01:40:29,279
"A-Aa-E-Ee, A-B-C-D
This is our time, buddy"

1677
01:40:29,321 --> 01:40:30,948
"Come, brother, welcome"

1678
01:40:35,202 --> 01:40:37,246
It is wrong only if I bash up the boys?

1679
01:40:37,287 --> 01:40:38,288
Yes

1680
01:40:41,583 --> 01:40:44,795
"World famous local master
will bash up any lowlife gangster"

1681
01:40:44,837 --> 01:40:48,340
"His cane will speak loud and clear
To reform a rowdy, law will persevere"

1682
01:40:48,423 --> 01:40:51,510
"If you come in to commit a crime
Master's raid will give you a hard time"

1683
01:40:51,552 --> 01:40:53,095
"Master's raid
Pain postpaid"

1684
01:40:53,136 --> 01:40:55,264
"Don't buy trouble for a fee
Turn your back and flee"

1685
01:40:55,305 --> 01:40:56,807
Why are you hitting us?

1686
01:40:56,849 --> 01:40:58,642
As master, think you can
get away hitting us?

1687
01:40:58,684 --> 01:41:00,060
'We are also wardens here'

1688
01:41:00,102 --> 01:41:02,521
We told you not to hit the boys
So why are you caning us?

1689
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:05,232
"Don't run over him and look the other way"

1690
01:41:05,315 --> 01:41:07,401
"Don't get into his bad books, stay away"

1691
01:41:07,442 --> 01:41:10,237
"Master's raid, no warranty
Pain 100% guarantee"

1692
01:41:10,571 --> 01:41:12,447
It hurts, sir
Please don't hit

1693
01:41:12,489 --> 01:41:15,242
Sir, I'm going to Sabarimala
I have taken the 48 days vow

1694
01:41:15,284 --> 01:41:18,829
Why? What happened to your devotion
when you were peddling drugs?

1695
01:41:18,871 --> 01:41:22,416
"He'll even the score and more
His blows blast fireworks encore"

1696
01:41:22,457 --> 01:41:23,709
"Who is the master?
Commander!"

1697
01:41:23,792 --> 01:41:25,335
"24 carat gold is he
Lion king royalty"

1698
01:41:25,377 --> 01:41:26,879
"Move aside
Watch his stride"

1699
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:28,463
"Shut the gate tight"

1700
01:41:44,605 --> 01:41:45,856
- Name?
- Bharath

1701
01:41:45,898 --> 01:41:47,149
- Sibi
- Karuppusami

1702
01:41:47,191 --> 01:41:48,192
- Dhanus
- 'Udaya'

1703
01:41:48,233 --> 01:41:49,234
- 'Venkatesh
- Stephen'

1704
01:41:49,318 --> 01:41:50,235
'Pencil'

1705
01:41:50,319 --> 01:41:52,696
Inspection it seems
All of you line up to one side

1706
01:41:52,779 --> 01:41:55,449
"He will take law into his hand
When discipline fails to stand"

1707
01:41:55,490 --> 01:41:57,409
"Master's raid will be well planned"

1708
01:41:57,451 --> 01:41:59,786
"When he uses his soft voice
Obey his rules, dear boys"

1709
01:41:59,828 --> 01:42:02,247
"If you defy however slight
his cane will hug you tight"

1710
01:42:02,289 --> 01:42:04,374
"Don't create a ruckus
His warning smile is dangerous"

1711
01:42:04,416 --> 01:42:06,293
"Accept your mistake, bro
he will let you go"

1712
01:42:06,335 --> 01:42:07,336
Good boy!

1713
01:42:07,377 --> 01:42:09,463
"What was that noise, lad?
Your nose is bleeding bad"

1714
01:42:09,505 --> 01:42:11,798
"Wherever you hide, dude
master's eyes will find you"

1715
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:14,176
"Listen to master's advice
you'll be wealthy and wise"

1716
01:42:14,218 --> 01:42:16,512
"If you act smart anymore
time to kneel on the floor"

1717
01:42:35,781 --> 01:42:37,908
"Don't stand and stare
Don't get caught again, beware"

1718
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:40,661
"Hit him once, you are out cold
He will retaliate multifold"

1719
01:42:41,286 --> 01:42:43,288
"Don't turn a blind eye
to a crime on the roadside"

1720
01:42:43,330 --> 01:42:45,499
"Says 'Thirukkural' wisely
Don't chicken out and flee"

1721
01:42:45,832 --> 01:42:47,918
"My followers devotedly
Will be true wholeheartedly"

1722
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:50,003
"Without discrimination
of caste, race, religion"

1723
01:42:50,045 --> 01:42:51,547

01:52:06,018 --> 01:52:08,896
Call whomever, how many ever boys
you want from here to play on your side

1879
01:52:08,937 --> 01:52:11,398
I'll call anyone I want but then
you can't go back on your word

1880
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:14,359
Call, we won't send you back
without breaking all your teeth today!

1881
01:52:17,154 --> 01:52:19,406
MAAASTER!

1882
01:52:20,908 --> 01:52:22,701
"Clash of wills here"

1883
01:52:24,453 --> 01:52:26,330
"You are ready for your bier"

1884
01:52:27,956 --> 01:52:29,708
[song from 'Ghilli']

1885
01:52:31,627 --> 01:52:34,713
"Kabaddi...kabaddi...do hold your breath"

1886
01:52:34,838 --> 01:52:38,717
"Kabaddi...kabaddi...to show your strength"

1887
01:52:46,350 --> 01:52:48,185
- Tell me, Madhi
- 'I checked the results'

1888
01:52:48,227 --> 01:52:51,021
I am sure all 6 of them
are above 20 years of age

1889
01:52:54,274 --> 01:52:56,026
"Kabaddi...kabaddi...play"

1890
01:52:56,068 --> 01:52:59,696
"On your mark, get set full gear
Sandalwood paste smeared"

1891
01:52:59,738 --> 01:53:02,699
"One foot in the grave, no fear
You are ready for your bier"

1892
01:53:02,866 --> 01:53:04,159
What are you saying?

1893
01:53:04,535 --> 01:53:06,537
Not one of them is less than 18?

1894
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:09,206
100% sure, in those 6 boys
no one is younger than 18

1895
01:53:15,587 --> 01:53:17,673
"On your mark, get set, ready"

1896
01:53:22,719 --> 01:53:24,388
"Bash them up deadly"

1897
01:53:26,014 --> 01:53:29,017
Master,. at least do you know
the name of this game?

1898
01:53:29,059 --> 01:53:31,103
'This is not cricket or football'

1899
01:53:31,144 --> 01:53:33,730
You must hold your breath and
repeat 'kabaddi', you know?

1900
01:53:35,190 --> 01:53:36,692
Our rules are different

1901
01:53:36,733 --> 01:53:38,360
You can't just touch and run

1902
01:53:38,652 --> 01:53:40,696
You must toss your opponent
outside the line

1903
01:53:40,737 --> 01:53:42,447
What...still want to play?

1904
01:53:45,033 --> 01:53:46,159
Come on, da

1905
01:53:59,882 --> 01:54:01,717
"Kabaddi...kabaddi...kabaddi...play"

1906
01:54:10,017 --> 01:54:12,352
Kabaddi...kabaddi...kabaddi

1907
01:54:13,353 --> 01:54:15,272
You're out if you step out of the line

1908
01:54:15,314 --> 01:54:17,316
"On your mark, get set, full gear"

1909
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:20,319
"Sandalwood paste smeared here"

1910
01:54:20,527 --> 01:54:21,987
Trying your tricks with us?

1911
01:54:22,362 --> 01:54:24,239
"You are ready for your bier"

1912
01:54:25,741 --> 01:54:27,534
"Your downfall is marked"

1913
01:54:29,369 --> 01:54:30,537
Bingo!

1914
01:54:31,038 --> 01:54:32,122
'He got a solid slap'

1915
01:54:35,125 --> 01:54:36,627
Knock him down

1916
01:54:57,189 --> 01:54:58,607
'He deserves it!'

1917
01:55:02,694 --> 01:55:05,030
- Soooper, master
- Come...face on

1918
01:55:05,239 --> 01:55:06,490
He is hitting us real hard

1919
01:55:06,490 --> 01:55:08,367
If you have the guts
show it now

1920
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:10,702
Come...come on

1921
01:55:10,869 --> 01:55:13,205
Kabaddi...kabaddi...kabaddi

1922
01:55:14,665 --> 01:55:16,250
Kabaddi...kabaddi...kabaddi

1923
01:55:17,334 --> 01:55:18,627
Lift him

1924
01:55:19,628 --> 01:55:22,339
You dare lay a finger on us
Just you wait and watch!

1925
01:55:23,465 --> 01:55:25,133
Come...come

1926
01:55:29,054 --> 01:55:31,306
How dare you break a boy's hand!

1927
01:55:31,598 --> 01:55:33,851
This is tit for tat time for you

1928
01:55:37,062 --> 01:55:38,856
[loud cheering]

1929
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:55,914
Kabbadi...kabbadi...kabbadi

1930
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:02,921
"All set to knock you down"

1931
01:56:02,963 --> 01:56:06,300
"Lick your defeat with face on the ground"

1932
01:56:06,341 --> 01:56:09,928
"On your mark, get set, ready to lose"

1933
01:56:09,970 --> 01:56:13,348
"One step to defeat, time for the noose"

1934
01:56:54,556 --> 01:56:58,101
"Get set, sandalwood paste smeared"

1935
01:56:58,143 --> 01:57:01,313
"Clash of wills here
Be ready to lie on your bier"

1936
01:57:02,731 --> 01:57:05,234
Kabaddi...kabaddi...touch the line"

1937
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:08,654
Watch the line

1938
01:57:10,489 --> 01:57:14,159
If you dare lay a finger
on these boys just once more

1939
01:57:15,702 --> 01:57:18,330
"Kabaddi...kabaddi...hold your breath"

1940
01:57:18,372 --> 01:57:22,876
"Kabaddi...touch to show your strength"

1941
01:57:23,961 --> 01:57:25,504
Master?

1942
01:57:25,921 --> 01:57:27,172
Master...?

1943
01:57:27,464 --> 01:57:29,466
- What?
- Is it okay to talk frankly?

1944
01:57:29,508 --> 01:57:31,885
- Camera is recording everything
- Go on, doesn't matter

1945
01:57:31,927 --> 01:57:33,178
I'll tell you, master

1946
01:57:33,220 --> 01:57:35,222
My mother passed away
when I was born

1947
01:57:35,848 --> 01:57:37,975
My neighbor sister raised me

1948
01:57:38,559 --> 01:57:41,311
My father asked that sister
if she will sleep with him!

1949
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:42,896
That's why

1950
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:45,107
I threw the grinding stone on his head

1951
01:57:45,148 --> 01:57:47,693
Immediately the police put me in jail

1952
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:50,863
'That's when I got
trapped with brother Das'

1953
01:57:50,904 --> 01:57:54,116
From then on I had to listen
only to what brother Das says

1954
01:57:56,034 --> 01:57:57,286
Brother Das will walk in

1955
01:57:57,369 --> 01:57:59,454
He will check who is addicted to drugs

1956
01:58:00,122 --> 01:58:03,041
Powder, smoke, booze
He will increase the dosage

1957
01:58:04,459 --> 01:58:06,170
Which one of you here

1958
01:58:07,462 --> 01:58:09,131
...has seen Bhavani?

1959
01:58:09,173 --> 01:58:10,424
Bhavani?

1960
01:58:10,632 --> 01:58:12,509
Where have I heard this name?

1961
01:58:12,551 --> 01:58:14,261
'Somehow sounds familiar'

1962
01:58:14,303 --> 01:58:15,304
Master

1963
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:18,640
We have heard this name
But none of us have seen him

1964
01:58:18,682 --> 01:58:21,059
Brother Das is 'be all and end all' here

1965
01:58:21,143 --> 01:58:22,895
We must obey him implicitly

1966
01:58:22,936 --> 01:58:25,564
'If he asks us to surrender
we should do so with our eyes closed'

1967
01:58:25,606 --> 01:58:26,940
Otherwise we will be hanged

1968
01:58:26,982 --> 01:58:28,525
'They recently hanged 2 boys'

1969
01:58:28,567 --> 01:58:30,110
'Didn't you see that, master?'

1970
01:58:31,612 --> 01:58:33,947
Do you all want to go home
and live with your family?

1971
01:58:34,239 --> 01:58:35,866
Or do you want to surrender?

1972
01:58:35,908 --> 01:58:37,910
- Go home, master
- Be with our family

1973
01:58:39,161 --> 01:58:40,996
You have been here for 10 days

1974
01:58:41,038 --> 01:58:43,248
We haven't taken to drugs till now

1975
01:58:43,290 --> 01:58:45,292
Only now we know
our own selves

1976
01:58:46,293 --> 01:58:48,545
Somehow save us from here, master

1977
01:58:48,629 --> 01:58:52,299
If you follow what I say, you can
go home and live as you wish

1978
01:58:52,341 --> 01:58:53,383
Will you do as I say?

1979
01:58:53,425 --> 01:58:55,636
- Yes, master
- We will

1980
01:58:55,677 --> 01:59:00,390
Whatever you shared with me now
will you tell the same to the magistrate?

1981
01:59:00,432 --> 01:59:02,392
Of course we will, master

1982
01:59:02,434 --> 01:59:05,229
I'll arrange all the formalities
to get them out on parole

1983
01:59:05,312 --> 01:59:06,313
Thanks, sir

1984
01:59:06,355 --> 01:59:08,482
Let the video evidence
be with Charu till then

1985
01:59:08,565 --> 01:59:10,526
It will reach the magistrate
when you say so

1986
01:59:10,567 --> 01:59:14,029
Master, you shot some video
and cleverly made us confess

1987
01:59:14,071 --> 01:59:15,989
You haven't shared your story

1988
01:59:15,989 --> 01:59:17,282
Tell us
Let's listen

1989
01:59:17,366 --> 01:59:18,450
'Ask him, da'

1990
01:59:18,450 --> 01:59:19,660
Cat got your tongue, huh?

1991
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:21,620
- Tell us
- Tell us, master

1992
01:59:21,662 --> 01:59:23,247
'Please share your story, master'

1993
01:59:23,288 --> 01:59:25,082
We are asking, right?
Please tell us

1994
01:59:25,123 --> 01:59:27,876
Don't ask for trouble
Trust my voice of experience!

1995
01:59:27,918 --> 01:59:29,753
Wait, they are very eager to hear

1996
01:59:29,837 --> 01:59:31,129
I'll be happy to share
Let them enjoy

1997
01:59:31,338 --> 01:59:33,257
I was in college then

1998
01:59:33,298 --> 01:59:35,050
'I think it was my final year'

1999
01:59:35,092 --> 01:59:38,220
A new teacher joined our college

2000
01:59:38,345 --> 01:59:40,138
Her name was Malar

2001
01:59:40,722 --> 01:59:42,933
Unbelievable one in a million 'Love'

2002
01:59:48,188 --> 01:59:50,148
All of a sudden that girl I loved

2003
01:59:50,691 --> 01:59:52,150
...met with an accident

2004
01:59:52,192 --> 01:59:53,652
'She forgot her past'

2005
01:59:53,694 --> 01:59:56,029
She didn't even know who I was

2006
01:59:56,363 --> 01:59:58,365
She even forgot my mad love for her

2007
01:59:58,740 --> 02:00:03,161
Fate made me attend her wedding
present a bouquet with my own hands!

2008
02:00:04,580 --> 02:00:05,873
After tha-

2009
02:00:06,874 --> 02:00:09,710
Dai! Why are all of you
sniffling and crying?

2010
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:12,129
Now that girl has totally
forgotten our past

2011
02:00:12,212 --> 02:00:14,548
Master, isn't that teacher sister Charu?

2012
02:00:14,590 --> 02:00:17,301
Hey, this sister is teacher
working as my colleague now

2013
02:00:17,342 --> 02:00:19,303
That was my college time

2014
02:00:19,344 --> 02:00:21,471
Down memory lane
Malar teacher

2015
02:00:21,513 --> 02:00:23,515
Dai, don't you watch Malayalam movies?

2016
02:00:23,557 --> 02:00:25,517
If I don't understand the language

2017
02:00:25,559 --> 02:00:26,643
- I won't watch
- Okay

2018
02:00:26,685 --> 02:00:28,478
Getting late
All of you leave

2019
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:30,689
Class tomorrow morning as usual

2020
02:00:30,731 --> 02:00:32,316
Okay, master
Bye, master

2021
02:00:32,357 --> 02:00:36,195
How much longer will you quote a film story
if someone asks you about your past life?

2022
02:00:36,236 --> 02:00:39,156
Fool yourself in the bargain
and trick others too?

2023
02:00:39,198 --> 02:00:40,616
Which is a film story?

2024
02:00:41,033 --> 02:00:42,159
Don't act

2025
02:00:42,201 --> 02:00:44,161
What you narrated was
Malayalam film 'Premam'

2026
02:00:44,161 --> 02:00:46,997
Copy cats! They stole my story
and it is released, huh?

2027
02:00:47,122 --> 02:00:49,666
One track mind
on plagiarism, huh?

2028
02:00:50,709 --> 02:00:53,337
Okay, what do you want to know?

2029
02:00:53,378 --> 02:00:54,379
Tell me

2030
02:00:54,421 --> 02:00:56,298
Why did you start drinking?

2031
02:00:57,674 --> 02:00:59,510
Every drunkard will have a story

2032
02:00:59,551 --> 02:01:00,844
Why go into it now?

2033
02:01:01,094 --> 02:01:02,387
If I tell you my reason

2034
02:01:02,429 --> 02:01:05,891

'He got admitted
in a hospital to get treated-'

That really shattered JD

But the hitch is

Every now and then, they will
make us surrender for a crime

'We must obey him implicitly'

2175
02:08:51,732 --> 02:08:53,984

- 'No one can defy him'

'He asks you to surrender
we should, with our eyes closed'

How did you lose track of her?

2178
02:08:58,113 --> 02:09:00,532
Don't know how, Bhavani
I sent only professionals

2179

- Somehow they messed up-
- Shut up!

2180

What do we do with this, bro?

2181
02:09:07,331 --> 02:09:11,293
It has a card inside which stores
whatever we shoot or click

2182
02:09:11,335 --> 02:09:14,546
Break that card alone and
keep the camera at my place

2183
02:09:15,088 --> 02:09:16,089
Okay

2184
02:09:16,131 --> 02:09:17,841
When are they announcing the results?

2185
02:09:17,883 --> 02:09:19,676
Heard it's Monday or Tuesday

2186

You'll anyway win unopposed

02:09:21,470 --> 02:09:23,096
Why should you be tense?

2188
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:25,891
- I can enjoy, right?
- Yes, then what?

2189
02:09:28,644 --> 02:09:29,853
Sit here

2190
02:09:32,606 --> 02:09:34,191
Do you know this ostrich?

2191
02:09:34,942 --> 02:09:37,194
A bird with a long neck like this

2192
02:09:37,236 --> 02:09:39,238
Have you seen its egg?
It will be this big

2193
02:09:39,363 --> 02:09:41,365
So big in size

2194
02:09:42,366 --> 02:09:45,160
But only that ostrich will know
the pain of hatching such an egg!

2195
02:09:46,411 --> 02:09:48,539
Will you sit here even after
I've explained to you?

2196
02:09:48,580 --> 02:09:50,040
No, Bava

2197
02:09:50,082 --> 02:09:51,625
- Get lost!
- No, Bhavani

2198
02:09:52,918 --> 02:09:55,254
Bhavani, boys want a booze party

2199
02:09:55,295 --> 02:09:56,672
You won't anyway drink

2200
02:09:56,713 --> 02:09:57,923
At least for them-

2201
02:09:59,341 --> 02:10:01,134
Drink to dig your own grave

2202
02:10:01,510 --> 02:10:03,554
- Go ahead
- Thanks a lot, Bhavani

2203
02:10:04,179 --> 02:10:05,973
- 'Goodnight, Bava'
- Goodnight

2204
02:10:10,477 --> 02:10:12,354
Somehow you made me
show you this place

2205
02:10:12,646 --> 02:10:14,731
I was staying away
from this place

2206
02:10:14,898 --> 02:10:16,316
Let's go back, master

2207
02:10:17,234 --> 02:10:19,236
Wait, I have a good reason

2208
02:10:19,278 --> 02:10:20,279
We'll go soon

2209
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:22,865
'Right, you haven't come here to eat'

2210
02:10:22,906 --> 02:10:26,702
- 'What happened to my chicken 'pakoda'?
- Narayana, serve him'

2211
02:10:27,369 --> 02:10:30,289
I thought you were inviting me
for a candle light dinner

2212
02:10:30,330 --> 02:10:32,291
Last time I came here,
there was no power

2213
02:10:32,332 --> 02:10:33,709
They had lit only candles

2214
02:10:36,044 --> 02:10:37,337
Okay, relax

2215
02:10:38,672 --> 02:10:40,340
Don't look at this place

2216
02:10:40,716 --> 02:10:42,968
I heard the food here is super

2217
02:10:43,969 --> 02:10:45,345
'Get a token for the meals'

2218
02:10:46,346 --> 02:10:47,639
'Madam, you too'

2219
02:10:48,348 --> 02:10:50,058
I thought we'll have some privacy

2220
02:10:50,100 --> 02:10:53,729
Close your eyes and
show me your right hand

2221
02:10:54,313 --> 02:10:56,315
- Why?
- Show, I'll tell you

2222
02:11:00,277 --> 02:11:02,988
You shouldn't open your eyes
till I tell you

2223
02:11:05,490 --> 02:11:06,450
'Open now'

2224
02:11:09,703 --> 02:11:12,456
That boy's hand in the salon
had this same mark

2225
02:11:12,497 --> 02:11:13,999
Show this over there

2226
02:11:14,583 --> 02:11:16,293
Ask for 'meals' token

2227
02:11:18,086 --> 02:11:19,463
Why should I-

2228
02:11:19,505 --> 02:11:21,423
All for a good reason
Go and show your hand

2229
02:11:55,707 --> 02:11:57,125
Who the hell is he?

2230
02:12:15,978 --> 02:12:18,313
'We don't differentiate or discriminate'

2231
02:12:19,231 --> 02:12:21,650
'Whoever has a Tamil letter 'pa'
tattooed on their hands...'

2232
02:12:21,692 --> 02:12:24,027
...we give them whatever they ask

2233
02:12:26,655 --> 02:12:29,032
Bhavani's boys will take care of the rest

2234
02:12:40,419 --> 02:12:41,920
What is this for?

2235
02:12:41,962 --> 02:12:43,881
Still some balance left
in my bucket list!

2236
02:13:05,360 --> 02:13:10,532
"Let the drums beat; no restraint
Let the party rock; no constraint"

2237
02:13:10,616 --> 02:13:15,662
"Let our army smash and slam
Our earth will quake with the wham"

2238
02:13:15,704 --> 02:13:20,375
"My hands will never miss a beat
when I beat the drum ever so neat"

2239
02:13:20,417 --> 02:13:24,296
"Even the dormant nerve will dance
hearing my drum's resonance"

2240
02:13:24,338 --> 02:13:25,506
'Beat it!'

2241
02:13:25,547 --> 02:13:30,135
"Till the sun rises to a new day
let the ground shake and sway"

2242
02:13:30,344 --> 02:13:35,224
"Till the game is won, job is done
slow down but have your fun"

2243
02:13:35,432 --> 02:13:39,269
"Even the Lord of Death Yama will die
if he glares with his razor sharp eye"

2244
02:13:39,311 --> 02:13:40,354
'Hey boy!'

2245
02:13:40,395 --> 02:13:44,399
"Light the camphor for our Lord
He is possessed by our demi-god"

2246
02:13:45,108 --> 02:13:49,988
"Look high and low diligently
Every nook & corner and alley"

2247
02:13:50,030 --> 02:13:54,159
"There is no other big gun to defy
Or create a ruckus and vilify"

2248
02:13:54,159 --> 02:13:55,160
'Bhavani!'

2249
02:14:08,966 --> 02:14:12,052
That master is churning in my mind

2250
02:14:12,261 --> 02:14:14,721
Tell him to kill that master
tomorrow before day break

2251
02:14:15,222 --> 02:14:18,308
Why wait till tomorrow morning?
We can close his chapter right now

2252
02:14:21,353 --> 02:14:23,939
Shut your gob
Just do what I say

2253
02:14:26,567 --> 02:14:30,737
"Let the force of his punching fist
make the drumhead rip and split"

2254
02:14:31,113 --> 02:14:35,534
"Let 'sound' listen to the thump and lo!
Announce who struck the blow"

2255
02:14:39,913 --> 02:14:40,914
'You there!'

2256
02:14:40,998 --> 02:14:45,961
"Let the force of his punching fist
make the drumhead rip and split"

2257
02:14:46,003 --> 02:14:50,382
"Let 'sound' listen to the thump and lo!
Announce who struck the blow"

2258
02:14:50,465 --> 02:14:54,928
"Shaking his stupor, without a doubt
he is all set to rip your gut out"

2259
02:14:55,053 --> 02:14:59,516
"To hang you upside down
and skin you alive is his vow"

2260
02:14:59,558 --> 02:15:00,684
'Master...!'

2261
02:15:10,736 --> 02:15:15,282
"Let the drums roll; no restraint
Let the party rock; no constraint"

2262
02:15:15,532 --> 02:15:20,120
"Let our army smash and slam
Our earth will quake with the wham"

2263
02:15:20,621 --> 02:15:25,542
"My hands will never miss a beat
when I beat the drum; it's a royal treat"

2264
02:15:25,584 --> 02:15:29,171
"Even the dormant nerve will dance
hearing my drum's resonance"

2265
02:15:29,213 --> 02:15:30,547
'Rock & roll'

2266
02:15:30,589 --> 02:15:35,969
"Till the sun rises to a new day
let the ground shake and sway"

2267
02:15:36,261 --> 02:15:37,930
Give me Dinkie Dow if you have

2268
02:15:37,971 --> 02:15:39,389
I don't stock drugs

2269
02:15:40,432 --> 02:15:44,228
"Even the Lord of Death Yama will die
if he glares with his razor sharp eye"

2270
02:15:44,353 --> 02:15:45,145
'Hey boy'

2271
02:15:45,354 --> 02:15:49,858
"Light the camphor for our Lord
He is possessed by our demi-god"

2272
02:16:15,926 --> 02:16:18,470
"Got the man with the plan right here"

2273
02:16:18,554 --> 02:16:20,973
"Bringin' swag with the man right here"

2274
02:16:21,098 --> 02:16:25,143
Forward all the videos
to the police department

2275
02:16:25,227 --> 02:16:28,981
I'll bring the boys
to the Magistrate directly

2276
02:16:29,106 --> 02:16:30,148
Okay

2277
02:16:31,608 --> 02:16:32,693
Master

2278
02:16:33,318 --> 02:16:35,153
This is Bhavani brother's truck

2279
02:16:35,279 --> 02:16:37,781
I've heard he comes here often

2280
02:16:39,491 --> 02:16:40,534
Let's go there

2281
02:16:40,617 --> 02:16:43,120
Aiyaiyo! Are you joking, master?

2282
02:16:43,203 --> 02:16:45,581
I am not coming
You go if you want

2283
02:16:50,544 --> 02:16:53,213
"A whole night of merry-making"

2284
02:16:54,298 --> 02:16:56,967
"Day spent in sleep overtaking"

2285
02:16:57,593 --> 02:17:03,599
"This is the world we rejoice
Reveling in unforbidden joys"

2286
02:17:05,601 --> 02:17:12,232
"A whole night of merry-making
Day spent in sleep overtaking"

2287
02:17:12,524 --> 02:17:18,530
"This is the world we rejoice
Reveling in unforbidden joys"

2288
02:17:20,157 --> 02:17:23,619
"A whole night of partying"

2289
02:17:23,660 --> 02:17:26,496
[song from 'Navarathiri']

2290
02:17:27,122 --> 02:17:30,584
"This is our universe
for better or worse"

2291
02:17:30,709 --> 02:17:32,878
You move I'll stab you

2292
02:17:32,961 --> 02:17:34,296
Walk straight ahead

2293
02:17:41,845 --> 02:17:44,306
"What existed before birth"

2294
02:17:44,348 --> 02:17:45,390
Knock, da

2295
02:17:45,432 --> 02:17:47,851
"Even you can't unearth"

2296
02:17:49,269 --> 02:17:50,812
To top it all
a secret code!

2297
02:17:50,854 --> 02:17:55,442
"What happens after we die
Even I don't know the right reply"

2298
02:17:57,194 --> 02:17:59,613
If any hand reaches out to his weapon

2299
02:18:00,364 --> 02:18:01,740
He will end up a corpse

2300
02:18:02,241 --> 02:18:03,450
Kneel, man

2301
02:18:04,368 --> 02:18:06,245
- Kneel down
- Switch off the song

2302
02:18:07,287 --> 02:18:08,956
Damn, switch it off!

2303
02:18:11,792 --> 02:18:13,377
Who is Bhavani here?

2304
02:18:14,503 --> 02:18:15,546
Huh?

2305
02:18:16,338 --> 02:18:18,298
Which one of you here
has seen Bhavani?

2306
02:18:34,606 --> 02:18:36,567
What kind of sissy name
is that...Bhavani?

2307
02:18:36,775 --> 02:18:39,486
Was he lying on his stomach
as a baby when he was named?

2308
02:18:44,116 --> 02:18:45,242
Shabaa!

2309
02:18:46,201 --> 02:18:47,953
Let me make it clear once more

2310
02:18:48,787 --> 02:18:52,082
If any of you do something stupid
trying to retaliate

2311
02:18:52,749 --> 02:18:55,460
I'll sign on your man's
Adam's apple, got it?

2312
02:18:55,752 --> 02:18:57,671
'Try your luck flinging another bottle?'

2313
02:18:57,963 --> 02:18:59,423
That means

2314
02:18:59,798 --> 02:19:02,593
You know Bhavani very well

2315
02:19:04,428 --> 02:19:07,347
Will you go and repeat this
to him verbatim?

2316
02:19:08,557 --> 02:19:10,100
Bhavani...Bhavani

2317
02:19:10,976 --> 02:19:12,686
Bhavani...Bhavani

2318
02:19:14,605 --> 02:19:17,441
A man walked in right royally
knowing it is your den, Bhavani

2319
02:19:18,609 --> 02:19:19,776
Repeat, da

2320
02:19:20,235 --> 02:19:21,945
No, you tell me
I'll convey it

2321
02:19:21,987 --> 02:19:24,615
No, you are scared

2322
02:19:25,699 --> 02:19:28,243
'Listen, I might as well tell all of you'

2323
02:19:28,285 --> 02:19:31,163
The day you killed those 2 boys in
the Observation Home and hung them

2324
02:19:31,205 --> 02:19:33,123
I hung my head in guilt and died

2325
02:19:33,707 --> 02:19:35,834
I'm least bothered about myself hereafter

2326
02:19:36,835 --> 02:19:39,922
Branding those juveniles with a tattoo
and making them do your dirty work

2327
02:19:39,963 --> 02:19:41,298
I've put a full stop to it

2328
02:19:41,632 --> 02:19:45,177
From now on, anyone wants to do anything
using the boys as lambs for the slaughter

2329
02:19:45,219 --> 02:19:47,888
...has to kill me and then go ahead
but that has a slight hitch

2330
02:19:48,722 --> 02:19:52,476
I will kill minimum 10 of you
and only then breathe my last

2331
02:19:53,936 --> 02:19:57,189
Be it Bhavani
or Banumathi!!!

2332
02:19:58,774 --> 02:20:00,609
Will you go and tell him
word by word?

2333
02:20:01,485 --> 02:20:02,778
Come, get up

2334
02:20:08,200 --> 02:20:09,409
Close the door

2335
02:20:26,635 --> 02:20:28,387
Who threw that bottle at me, da?

2336
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:31,890
Come here

2337
02:20:31,932 --> 02:20:33,392
No, Bhavani

2338
02:20:33,433 --> 02:20:35,435
I aimed it at him

2339
02:20:35,477 --> 02:20:38,146
The pen will fall down and
you can escape I thought

2340
02:20:38,188 --> 02:20:39,398
'But it missed and-'

2341
02:20:39,606 --> 02:20:41,650
Hey! Lazy lout
Open the door

2342
02:20:41,692 --> 02:20:42,860
- 'Open the door
- Madcap!'

2343
02:20:42,901 --> 02:20:45,404
- Open the door, da
- What false bravado!

2344
02:20:45,445 --> 02:20:47,364
Son of a scumbag!
Open it, damn you

2345
02:20:47,406 --> 02:20:49,783
Where did you go?
Open now, I'll kill you

2346
02:20:49,867 --> 02:20:50,909
'Hey! Open'

2347
02:20:50,909 --> 02:20:53,120
'How dare you lay a hand
on Bhavani when I'm here?'

2348
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:54,162
- Kottamuthu
- Come now

2349
02:20:54,246 --> 02:20:56,164
- Hey Kottamuthu
- What did you think of us?

2350
02:20:56,206 --> 02:20:57,916
Bro is calling you

2351
02:20:57,958 --> 02:20:58,959
Come here

2352
02:21:00,752 --> 02:21:03,547
- What are you doing?
- He locked us in

2353
02:21:03,589 --> 02:21:05,674
He was holding a knife
to my neck for an hour

2354
02:21:05,716 --> 02:21:07,176
WTH were you doing then?

2355
02:21:07,217 --> 02:21:09,386
Bhavani, that wasn't a knife

2356
02:21:09,595 --> 02:21:11,972
- It was a pen
- You knew it, huh?

2357
02:21:12,097 --> 02:21:14,933
How will he open the door
if you yell after he has gone?

2358
02:21:14,975 --> 02:21:16,518
Shall we pen him a letter?

2359
02:21:16,560 --> 02:21:18,145
'Sir, please open the door'

2360
02:21:21,523 --> 02:21:22,983
Don't hit me, Bhavani

2361
02:21:30,115 --> 02:21:31,241
Who can draw very well here?

2362
02:21:31,283 --> 02:21:32,910
Master, he is our best artist

2363
02:21:32,910 --> 02:21:36,413
He's the madcap who doodles foul stuff
all over the toilet and the walls, master

2364
02:21:38,373 --> 02:21:39,374
'Hi master'

2365
02:21:39,416 --> 02:21:40,959
I believe you came to my den

2366
02:21:41,084 --> 02:21:44,379
Threatened a man with a pen and
conveyed an important message to Bhavani

2367
02:21:44,421 --> 02:21:45,797
I am that Bhavani

2368
02:21:45,881 --> 02:21:46,924
'Vanakkam'

2369
02:21:46,965 --> 02:21:51,595
If you destroy all that I own,
textile shop, hotel, wine shop

2370
02:21:52,179 --> 02:21:55,557
What the hell will he do?
He is himself a criminal

2371
02:21:55,599 --> 02:21:57,768
'You assumed I won't
go to the police, right?'

2372
02:21:57,809 --> 02:21:59,686
Your assumption is 100% right

2373
02:21:59,853 --> 02:22:01,730
But thinking you'll make
a fool of me was wrong

2374
02:22:01,772 --> 02:22:02,981
'I enquired about you'

2375
02:22:03,106 --> 02:22:05,692
I believe you have a big gang
of ardent fan followers

2376
02:22:05,734 --> 02:22:08,529
'Which one of them can I finish off?
I asked my boys their choice'

2377
02:22:08,570 --> 02:22:11,907
They said we can have a jolly time
killing them all without discrimination

2378
02:22:11,990 --> 02:22:14,785
Let me give you a task
Take a pen and paper'

2379
02:22:14,868 --> 02:22:18,830
List out your favorites
in alphabetical order

2380
02:22:18,872 --> 02:22:20,123
Hey Bhavani!

2381
02:22:20,165 --> 02:22:23,085
Don't ignore girls and kids
thinking I'll be soft on them

2382
02:22:23,126 --> 02:22:25,212
Include their names too definitely

2383
02:22:25,254 --> 02:22:27,548
'Write and call each one of them'

2384
02:22:27,589 --> 02:22:29,591
And then...master?

2385
02:22:31,426 --> 02:22:32,678
Give me the phone

2386
02:22:32,719 --> 02:22:33,887
'Hello...?'

2387
02:22:34,137 --> 02:22:36,181
- Why did he hang up on me?
- 'Must have got scared'

2388
02:22:36,223 --> 02:22:37,432
Got very emotional I guess

2389
02:22:38,433 --> 02:22:41,395
Why do emotional men
get so hyper and angry?

2390
02:22:46,733 --> 02:22:49,570
Pick...pick...pick up my call

2391
02:22:54,116 --> 02:22:55,409
Pick up

2392
02:22:55,450 --> 02:22:56,660
- Hi, dude
- Where are you?

2393
02:22:56,660 --> 02:22:57,911
I'm just leaving my office

2394
02:22:57,953 --> 02:22:59,705
- You are safe?
- Yes, what's the problem?

2395
02:22:59,746 --> 02:23:01,582
'Listen to me
Don't step out'

2396
02:23:01,623 --> 02:23:03,417
What is the proble-

2397
02:23:04,168 --> 02:23:05,627
Come on, pick up

2398
02:23:06,295 --> 02:23:07,546
- Sir?
- WHERE ARE YOU?

2399
02:23:07,588 --> 02:23:09,089
- Shut u-
- 'I hope you're safe?'

2400
02:23:09,131 --> 02:23:10,757
- 'Yes, sir, what happened?'
- Listen

2401
02:23:10,841 --> 02:23:13,594
Check if our batch students
are safe, okay?

2402
02:23:13,635 --> 02:23:15,137
'Madhi, where is Srinath?'

2403
02:23:15,179 --> 02:23:16,180
'He is here, JD'

2404
02:23:16,221 --> 02:23:17,973
- What is it?
- 'Stay at home, don't go out'

2405
02:23:18,015 --> 02:23:19,099
'Everything safe?'

2406
02:23:19,141 --> 02:23:20,225
JD called me

2407
02:23:20,267 --> 02:23:21,643
'He was so hassled'

2408
02:23:21,685 --> 02:23:23,520
'He told us not to step out'

2409
02:23:23,562 --> 02:23:26,440
Guys, don't step out of your house
Most important, avoid road travel

2410
02:23:26,481 --> 02:23:30,194
'In case you are out, go to any house
or shop nearby or any safe place'

2411
02:23:30,235 --> 02:23:32,654
'JD sir called just now
I think there's a major problem'

2412
02:23:32,696 --> 02:23:33,989
'If you are safe'

2413
02:23:34,114 --> 02:23:36,116
For heaven's sake
text our entire group

2414
02:23:36,158 --> 02:23:37,242
Park the bike

2415
02:23:40,621 --> 02:23:42,915
'Almost everyone in the group
texted they are safe'

2416
02:23:42,956 --> 02:23:45,751
But we couldn't reach
only Bhargav and Savitha, sir

2417
02:23:45,792 --> 02:23:47,419
Don't swerve too much to the right

2418
02:23:47,878 --> 02:23:49,338
Careful!

2419
02:23:52,758 --> 02:23:53,842
Hello?

2420
02:23:53,884 --> 02:23:54,927
I am safe-

2421
02:23:57,721 --> 02:23:58,889
Vanathi, where are you?

2422
02:23:58,931 --> 02:24:00,557
In a mall nearby
What happened?

2423
02:24:00,599 --> 02:24:02,392
- Is Prem with you?
- 'Yes, da'

2424
02:24:02,434 --> 02:24:04,394
He has gone to fetch
my purse from the car-

2425
02:24:06,271 --> 02:24:07,272
'VANATHI, WHAT IS IT?'

2426
02:24:07,314 --> 02:24:08,690
'What happened, Vanathi?'

2427
02:24:08,774 --> 02:24:10,317
'VANATHI, TALK TO ME
What is it?

Hey!

2435
02:24:25,582 --> 02:24:26,917
Hey! Get out

2436
02:24:26,959 --> 02:24:28,794
- What happened?
- Savitha, go

2437
02:24:28,836 --> 02:24:30,254
'Bhargav'

2438
02:24:30,295 --> 02:24:32,506
BHARGAV!

2439
02:24:32,589 --> 02:24:33,799
'Bhargav...!'

How many wickets down?

'According to the News I got'

2448
02:25:21,346 --> 02:25:22,931
2 wickets down
2 retired hurt

2449
02:25:23,974 --> 02:25:27,269
If you are still stubborn enough
to hang out with that gang

2450
02:25:27,311 --> 02:25:28,979
...you'll lose 4 wickets daily

who has crossed my path till now'

This is my first time
and I am forgiving you

2453
02:25:34,568 --> 02:25:37,905
Just quit your job, do an 'about turn'
and disappear from this town

2454

'Otherwise one who escaped today
will die tomorrow and repeat'

2455

It will go on repeat mode

2456

They will keep falling like ninepins
Thank you and good bye

I was on my back

02:27:48,160 --> 02:27:51,163
"He was chewing betel leaves in bliss
I punched his nose without a miss"

2496
02:27:51,246 --> 02:27:54,374
"You should have seen blood gush out
This Amaran's heart is gold, no doubt"

2497
02:27:54,416 --> 02:27:56,585
[Singing a song from 'Amaran']

2498
02:27:56,627 --> 02:27:59,505
"Just utter the name 'Amaran', bro
soda bottles will fly at our foe"

2499
02:27:59,546 --> 02:28:01,381
I don't care two hoots
about the repercussion

2500
02:28:01,423 --> 02:28:03,967
I'll take full blame
Beat the hell out of them

2501
02:28:04,593 --> 02:28:05,594
Hold this

2502
02:28:05,636 --> 02:28:08,263
"It's a lilting tune anyone can hum"

2503
02:28:08,305 --> 02:28:11,433
"Amaran is a seasoned singer awesome"

2504
02:28:11,475 --> 02:28:14,436
"He was chewing betel leaves in bliss
I punched his nose without a miss"

2505
02:28:14,478 --> 02:28:17,189
"Should have seen his nose bleed
This Amaran's heart is gold indee-"

2506
02:28:17,231 --> 02:28:18,232
Master...master, da

2507
02:28:18,482 --> 02:28:19,566
Back again?

2508
02:28:22,986 --> 02:28:24,363
Plan to hit us?

2509
02:28:24,404 --> 02:28:25,489
Go ahead

2510
02:28:32,663 --> 02:28:33,914
Come here

2511
02:28:34,957 --> 02:28:37,334
Think you've achieved
something great in life

2512
02:28:38,836 --> 02:28:40,295
Shout all you want

2513
02:28:41,588 --> 02:28:42,464
Dai!

2514
02:28:44,132 --> 02:28:45,217
Bhargav

2515
02:28:46,468 --> 02:28:47,928
He is dead, da

2516
02:28:52,975 --> 02:28:56,311
Bhargav created much more trouble
in college than all of you put together

2517
02:28:56,603 --> 02:28:57,771
He is dead now

2518
02:28:58,146 --> 02:29:03,443
If a real rowdy reforms and just when
he wants to lead a good life, if he dies-

2519
02:29:03,485 --> 02:29:05,487
Do you know it is
the height of cruelty?

2520
02:29:05,779 --> 02:29:08,657
The faith people around him have
to turn over a new leaf will vanish

2521
02:29:08,699 --> 02:29:10,200
Oh my gawd!

2522
02:29:10,242 --> 02:29:12,160
Master has started preaching to us

2523
02:29:12,160 --> 02:29:13,245
Ignore them, bro

2524
02:29:13,370 --> 02:29:15,497
Why do you treat them
on an equal footing with you?

2525
02:29:15,581 --> 02:29:17,332
These mongrels won't reform
even if they die!

2526
02:29:17,374 --> 02:29:19,334
Yov! Who will reform?

2527
02:29:19,877 --> 02:29:22,337
When have we treated him with respect?

2528
02:29:22,379 --> 02:29:24,798
Or given him time, place
or an opportunity to reform?

2529
02:29:25,549 --> 02:29:28,510
Undiyal, Odacha Kadalai, Bottle Mani,
Soda Sekar, what kind of names?

2530
02:29:28,552 --> 02:29:31,305
Then how will they remember
their family or tender love and care?

2531
02:29:32,472 --> 02:29:34,433
Family and society alienate them

2532
02:29:34,516 --> 02:29:36,685
If everybody has exiled him
how will he reform?

2533
02:29:39,521 --> 02:29:40,731
Come here, da

2534
02:29:40,898 --> 02:29:41,982
What?

2535
02:29:42,900 --> 02:29:46,111
1st crime by many boys here
is based on emotion quotient

2536
02:29:46,778 --> 02:29:48,780
Affection, betrayal, anger,
or a rush of adrenalin

2537
02:29:48,780 --> 02:29:50,115
Each with a reason

2538
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:52,534
But after the first time

2539
02:29:52,618 --> 02:29:56,747
You know what instigates you to commit
every crime you pile on to your account?

2540
02:29:57,331 --> 02:29:58,582
Intoxication!

2541
02:30:01,460 --> 02:30:03,253
I can bet on this, da

2542
02:30:03,462 --> 02:30:06,673
All other crimes after your 1st was
committed losing control of your senses

2543
02:30:06,715 --> 02:30:08,926
Didn't you booze?
Didn't you have a ball?

2544
02:30:08,967 --> 02:30:10,344
Oh! Yes, sir

2545
02:30:10,427 --> 02:30:11,553
Open your warped mind!

2546
02:30:11,845 --> 02:30:13,889
Only a drunkard can talk
of how it ruined his family

2547
02:30:14,681 --> 02:30:16,350
Only because of my addiction

2548
02:30:17,351 --> 02:30:19,603
2 boys lost their lives
I got that into my thick head

2549
02:30:20,229 --> 02:30:21,271
I quit drinking

2550
02:30:21,313 --> 02:30:23,982
'Chee! Don't be a drama king, master!'

2551
02:30:24,107 --> 02:30:25,567
Am I brewing liquor at home?

2552
02:30:25,609 --> 02:30:27,277
Blaming the buyer
instead of the seller!

2553
02:30:27,319 --> 02:30:30,864
That's exactly what I'm saying
This intoxication is a political game

2554
02:30:31,740 --> 02:30:34,243
You are not yet 18 years
You can't watch this Adult film

2555
02:30:34,284 --> 02:30:36,370
A security guard stands out
to push you out, right?

2556
02:30:36,620 --> 02:30:38,872
Why is no one standing guard
outside a wine shop?

2557
02:30:38,914 --> 02:30:42,543
How do 10 -15 year olds get hold
of a booze bottle and cigarette?

2558
02:30:43,919 --> 02:30:45,379
Politics

2559
02:30:46,964 --> 02:30:49,591
Bhavani is moving his pawn
and playing this kind of politics

2560
02:30:50,217 --> 02:30:52,469
When the law is against child labor

2561
02:30:52,553 --> 02:30:55,973
...that beast is forcing the same boys
into nefarious activities unwillingly

2562
02:30:59,726 --> 02:31:00,936
What is this?

2563
02:31:01,562 --> 02:31:02,771
What is it?

2564
02:31:02,855 --> 02:31:05,607
Like bribing you to vote and
you end up with an inked finger

2565
02:31:05,649 --> 02:31:08,610
He gives you freebies and
brands you with a tattoo

2566
02:31:09,611 --> 02:31:13,532
He has bathed you in basic amenities
providing free food and clothing

2567
02:31:16,285 --> 02:31:17,870
Good lord!

2568
02:31:19,371 --> 02:31:20,664
Enough of this atrocity

2569
02:31:21,248 --> 02:31:25,544
You have packed those boys who believed
they have a good future into that truck

2570
02:31:26,712 --> 02:31:29,631
Don't know if they will hang from a fan
or be run over by a tyre

2571
02:31:30,674 --> 02:31:31,717
But

2572
02:31:32,593 --> 02:31:34,094
I will save them

2573
02:31:34,595 --> 02:31:36,346
Every single one of them

2574
02:31:42,853 --> 02:31:44,229
What did he say, da?

2575
02:31:44,688 --> 02:31:46,857
He will kill all those who like me?

2576
02:31:47,399 --> 02:31:48,567
Hey!

2577
02:31:48,609 --> 02:31:50,360
[ironical laughter]

2578
02:31:51,445 --> 02:31:54,531
There are zillions outside who like me
Mind, body, heart and soul, da

2579
02:31:57,117 --> 02:31:58,869
Ask him to try his luck

2580
02:32:02,372 --> 02:32:08,212
'Bro, Bhavani has loaded the documents,
money bags of his 'benamis' in his lorries'

2581
02:32:08,253 --> 02:32:10,797
'He is planning to
cross the border tonight'

2582
02:32:11,215 --> 02:32:13,008
'The boys are in one of the trucks, bro'

2583
02:32:24,186 --> 02:32:25,354
Bhavani

2584
02:32:25,437 --> 02:32:27,314
All 40 lorries have crossed the border

2585
02:32:27,356 --> 02:32:28,815
Expected anytime now

2586
02:32:29,775 --> 02:32:31,109
Those boys?

2587
02:32:31,151 --> 02:32:33,362
Das is bringing them in the container

2588
02:34:00,574 --> 02:34:01,742
Go

2589
02:34:38,320 --> 02:34:39,571
Finish her off!

2590
02:34:42,616 --> 02:34:44,034
Vanathi...Vanathi

2591
02:34:47,037 --> 02:34:48,413
Run over her

2592
02:34:49,122 --> 02:34:50,374
Vanathi

2593
02:34:57,756 --> 02:34:59,299
Vanathi, take the wheel

2594
02:36:12,247 --> 02:36:13,957
Come...come

2595
02:36:49,785 --> 02:36:51,411
Bang his car and kill them

2596
02:37:10,472 --> 02:37:11,598
Come...come

2597
02:37:12,474 --> 02:37:13,725
'Stop...stop'

2598
02:37:15,227 --> 02:37:18,063
If those 15 boys turn approvers
whom will they point their fingers at?

2599
02:37:18,105 --> 02:37:19,147
Das of course

2600
02:37:19,231 --> 02:37:21,149
They have never met you, Bhavani

2601
02:37:21,191 --> 02:37:23,110
What if Das turns approver?

2602
02:37:29,283 --> 02:37:30,826
Your name, Bhavani

2603
02:37:31,076 --> 02:37:32,661
Then kill Das

2604
02:37:57,227 --> 02:37:58,270
Go

2605
02:37:58,312 --> 02:37:59,396
Go, da

2606
02:38:00,731 --> 02:38:03,025
Do you want him to kill me
out of your sight?

2607
02:38:03,066 --> 02:38:04,401
Your words came to my mind

2608
02:38:05,152 --> 02:38:07,279
'I will give my life for you'

2609
02:38:08,071 --> 02:38:09,239
Give it now

2610
02:38:12,117 --> 02:38:14,411
I thought of you
as my own elder brother

2611
02:38:14,453 --> 02:38:17,039
I regarded you as my brother

2612
02:38:17,080 --> 02:38:19,374
Even I thought of you
as my very own younger brother

2613
02:38:19,833 --> 02:38:21,126
'What do you want me to do?'

2614
02:38:21,168 --> 02:38:22,461
Where are the boys?

2615
02:38:23,420 --> 02:38:24,922
Where are they, da?

2616
02:38:25,881 --> 02:38:28,634
Hey! Go and check the container

2617
02:38:30,552 --> 02:38:32,429
Go...move it

2618
02:38:47,236 --> 02:38:48,278
Bloody-

2619
02:38:50,072 --> 02:38:51,573
Let's see who wins
You or me?

2620
02:38:51,615 --> 02:38:52,866
Das, listen to me

2621
02:38:53,075 --> 02:38:54,993
Listen to me
JUST LISTEN!

2622
02:38:56,328 --> 02:38:57,454
Hear me out

2623
02:38:58,038 --> 02:39:01,625
Oral statement by all those boys
point fingers accusingly only at you

2624
02:39:02,084 --> 02:39:04,419
They don't even know the name Bhavani

2625
02:39:04,962 --> 02:39:06,213
Bhavani knows that too

2626
02:39:06,338 --> 02:39:07,756
Give it serious thought

2627
02:39:07,840 --> 02:39:09,591
Will he kill all the boys?

2628
02:39:09,633 --> 02:39:12,678
Or kill the one they are pointing
fingers at, which is YOU?

2629
02:39:12,719 --> 02:39:15,389
- You deserve to die
- In one swift blow, I'll-

2630
02:39:17,558 --> 02:39:18,976
That is not my intention

2631
02:39:19,434 --> 02:39:21,854
Let's stop with the lives already lost

2632
02:39:22,563 --> 02:39:24,273
I'm saying this like a broken record

2633
02:39:24,314 --> 02:39:25,399
Bhavani is clever

2634
02:39:25,440 --> 02:39:28,026
He won't kill the boys
His target is YOU

2635
02:39:29,236 --> 02:39:31,071
Listen to me once
Only this time

2636
02:39:31,446 --> 02:39:34,783
Ask him if you can bring the boys
in front of him he will say 'no'

2637
02:39:35,117 --> 02:39:36,410
Continue to ask repeatedly

2638
02:39:36,451 --> 02:39:38,662
You'll know the true colors of Bhavani

2639
02:39:39,246 --> 02:39:40,831
If this doesn't happen-

2640
02:39:43,083 --> 02:39:44,835
I am all yours to kill

2641
02:41:39,074 --> 02:41:40,868
"Master"

2642
02:41:41,201 --> 02:41:43,245
"They call me...master"

2643
02:41:44,037 --> 02:41:46,039
"You know me...master"

2644
02:41:47,416 --> 02:41:49,209
"I am master the blaster"

2645
02:41:49,251 --> 02:41:50,627
"Oooh yeah!"

2646
02:41:50,669 --> 02:41:51,920
"Master"

2647
02:41:52,629 --> 02:41:54,256
"They call me...master"

2648
02:41:56,800 --> 02:41:57,926
Welcome, master

2649
02:42:00,053 --> 02:42:02,389
This is the first time
we are meeting, right?

2650
02:42:06,643 --> 02:42:08,896
Loaded with emotion, huh?

2651
02:42:09,897 --> 02:42:11,106
My dear master

2652
02:42:13,734 --> 02:42:15,736
Bhavani isn't just a name

You can't create a world record

If he was sharing his pearls of wisdom
what about the mud between your ears?

02:42:28,624 --> 02:42:30,417
You carried that boy on your waist?

2657
02:42:31,168 --> 02:42:32,920
Did you think they are kids?

2658
02:42:34,171 --> 02:42:36,006
They are killers of the worst kind

2659
02:42:38,300 --> 02:42:40,302
I've already given you too much time

2660
02:42:40,344 --> 02:42:42,012
Still I'll give you 2 minutes

2662

Master, why did you hit me in mid speech?

2663
02:42:49,061 --> 02:42:50,562
Didn't you ask for it?

2664
02:42:51,271 --> 02:42:52,439
Come

2665
02:42:52,606 --> 02:42:54,816

Hey! I am fighting here for your sake

So your hands don't grip

Your mind should not
go back to its old way

I am fighting your cause

Not one of you

2677
02:45:58,667 --> 02:46:00,711
Not even one of you
should raise his hand

In such a game we were lucky
My friend and I won 2 tickets

You would have seen everyone

for the very 1st time

...she's already engaged

2756
02:52:55,918 --> 02:52:58,754
After that, as we were sailing smoothly

2757
02:52:58,837 --> 02:53:01,006
The ship hit an iceberg on the way?

2758
02:53:02,174 --> 02:53:03,383
How do you know that?

2759
02:53:03,425 --> 02:53:04,885
I'll wait outside, master
